# Capstone - Steam Store Games

__Note:__ GitHub will be updated again when more of the project is completed.

## Problem Statement:
Using data from Steam Games combined with data from Steam Spy, I will seek to identify games and genres with high ratings that people are playing these days and target to identify any possible relationship between ratings and genre (if possible, depending on the data). A recommender will then be built for people who would like to have suggestions on other games that they will be interested in.

Should time permits, the recommender can be built into an application for others to use.


## Acknowledgement:
Much thanks to the API explanation / guide set out by Nik Davis in his GitHub ([link](https://nik-davis.github.io/posts/2019/steam-data-collection/)), which without I think I would have spent much longer time finding out how to get the data extracted from Steam.
