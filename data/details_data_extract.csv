Having just made it back onto the streets of Liberty City after a long stretch in maximum security, Tommy Vercetti is sent to Vice City by his old boss, Sonny Forelli.

But all does not go smoothly upon his arrival in the glamorous, hedonistic metropolis of Vice City. He's set up and is left with no money and no merchandise. Sonny wants his money back, but the biker gangs, Cuban gangsters, and corrupt politicians stand in his way. Most of Vice City seems to want Tommy dead. His only answer is to fight back and take over the city himself."

<br />
A group of stalkers, for the first time, reaches the very heart of the Zone-the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant-and triggers a cataclysm on the brink of a catastrophe. An immense blast of anomalous energy transforms the Zone: the once reliable and relatively safe roads are no longer so, the landscape is wiped clean by outbursts of anomalies, and previously unknown areas appear on the Zone map. Stalkers and expeditions perish or end up isolated within the lost territories.<br />
<br />
With the anomalous activity at its maximum, the unstable Zone continues to tremor with outbursts. The transformation of the Zone map destabilizes the fragile balance of forces in the Zone. Hostilities for the new territories, artifact fields and spheres of influence flare up among groups. There are no more old enemies or friends - now, everyone watches out only for themselves. The Factions War has begun.<br />
<br />
The protagonist is a mercenary who appeared at the edge of the opposition between stalker factions, Strelok and even the Zone itself. The main character experiences the key role in the events that led to the creation of the Zone right up to the point from which the original S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game begins.<br />
<br />
What new challenges await stalkers within the depths of the new zone? Why do anomalous outbursts continue to rattle the Zone, and what can be done to stop them? Which faction will take the upper hand in the Factions War? These and many other questions will be answered in the official prequel - S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky."

Here, the ruins of a great civilization of Aliens have recently been discovered. Huge factories and sprawling cities are falling into decay. Fragments of ships lie on the fields where massive battles were once fought. But there is not a living soul. Everything has been destroyed by a mysterious Cataclysm — a pulsing anomaly that burned out all life within this sector.<br><br>This doesn’t stop mankind, the new «owner» of the Universe.

For each objective captured, they gain more reinforcement and time to attack the next. Defenders have a finite amount of reinforcements and must use each wisely. Once the third objective is captured by the attackers, a fourth cache objective must be destroyed, while the defenders have only one life to make a last stand.<br><br><i>Firefight</i> --- Three territorial objectives, one for each team, plus one neutral. Each team only respawns when they secure an objective. Secure all objectives or eliminate all enemy to win. Every life counts, making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork.<br><br><i>Skirmish</i> --- In addition to three territorial objectives, each team has a supply cache to protect. Teams gain extra reinforcement waves until their cache is destroyed. When both teams have lost their caches and all reinforcement waves, it becomes a Firefight match.<br><br><i>Occupy</i> --- There is one central territorial objective in the area. The team that controls it does not deplete reinforcement waves. This gameplay in this mode is reminiscent to King of the Hill or &quot;tug of war&quot;.<br><br><i>Ambush</i> --- A high value target (&quot;HVT&quot;) must be escorted to an extraction point. It's one team's goal to make this happen and it's the other team's goal to stop this from happening at all costs. The HVT is only armed with a silenced pistol, but can pick up a weapon from a fallen enemy or teammate.<br><br><i>Strike</i> --- Three weapon caches must be destroyed by the attacking team to achieve victory. Destroying a cache earns the attackers more reinforcements and time on the clock. The defenders must retain at least one cache from being destroyed and eliminate the enemy team once their reinforcements run dry.<br><br><i>Infiltrate</i> --- The standard Capture the Flag mode, but with a twist. Your team's goal is to take the enemy's intel and return it to your base. Your team will only gain reinforcements when someone takes the enemy's intel, or when an enemy stealing your team's intel is neutralized. This mode requires very strong team coordination and strategy.<br><br><i>Flashpoint</i> --- One neutral territorial objective and two caches on each side. The goal is to secure the entire area, controlling the middle and destroying the enemy's caches.

223830.0,Xenonauts,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/223830/header.jpg?t=1560507441,"Xenonauts is a strategy game in which you control a multi-national military organisation defending a Cold War-era Earth from alien invasion, using small squads of persistent soldiers to eliminate the extraterrestrials and recover their technology in turn-based ground combat. A detailed strategic layer allows you to co-ordinate the defence of the planet, using your interceptors to shoot down UFOs and researching captured artefacts to learn about your foes and unlock new combat equipment to use on your missions.<br><br>Xenonauts is a spiritual successor to the classic X-Com strategy games from the 1990s. We aim to improve the graphics, add new content and streamline the interface whilst still retaining all of the key mechanics of the original games. Devoted fans should love this game, but we're also keen to introduce the joys of old-school grand strategy to a whole new generation of players who might not otherwise experience it!<br><br>Please note that the native Mac / Linux versions of the game are still in beta, however older WINE-wrapped &quot;ports&quot; are available and known to be stable whilst development of the native ports is still ongoing.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Key Features</h2><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li> Ground Combat: Xenonauts delivers tense turn-based combat across realistic, varied and fully-destructible battlefields, against almost fifty different variants of enemy. Missions range from capturing crashed UFOs or alien bases to defending cities (or even Xenonaut facilities) against alien attack. You'll experience the chill of encountering a new alien for the first time and the joys of test-firing a new weapon for the first time. Deeply asymmetric combat keeps the battles interesting - after all, you're fighting intergalactic invaders with 1970's ballistic technology!</li></ul><ul class=""bb_ul""><li> Strategic Management: You will also be managing the defence of the planet, dealing with the invading alien UFOs with your customisable interceptors. You need to balance the needs of your funding nations with your own. Your funds are limited - are you going to spend them on battlefield equipment, more scientists, or expanding your coverage of the planet? Your priorities must be balanced carefully if you are to win the war.</li></ul><ul class=""bb_ul""><li> Research Tree: Xenonauts has an extensive research tree with almost a hundred projects to unlock, each with its own unique description and painted artwork. It slowly reveals the intentions and origins of the invaders, while also unlocking new battlefield equipment, aircraft and vehicles for you to use as you harness alien technology and turn it against them. </li></ul><ul class=""bb_ul""><li> Persistent Soldiers: Soldiers in Xenonauts are persistent from mission to mission, improving their stats and gaining ranks with combat experience - but their deaths are always only a single bad move away. You will grow to care about the brave men and women under your command as they slowly grow from green rookies into hardened veterans, but that only makes it more painful when their heroic tale is cruelly cut short by a burst of plasma fire...</li></ul><ul class=""bb_ul""><li> Detailed, Emergent Simulation: Xenonauts contains no scripted missions, just broad rules setting the pace of the invasion. As such, no game plays out the same twice. If you shoot a Scout UFO down over a polar area, you get a Crash Site mission where you can capture a crashed Scout UFO in an Arctic tileset. Commence a battle at night and you'll be fighting the mission in the darkness with reduced sight range. If your base is attacked, you fight the defence in a perfect replica of your base. A lot of time has gone into weaving the two very different halves of the game together into something that feels both natural and enjoyable.</li></ul>"

225260.0,Brutal Legend,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/225260/header.jpg?t=1584655158,"Brütal Legend is an action-adventure that marries visceral action combat with open-world freedom. Set in a universe somewhere between Lord of the Rings and Spinal Tap, it’s a fresh take on the action/driving genre, which in this case is full of imitation cover bands, demons intent on enslaving humanity and Heavy metal tunes. Featuring the talents of comedian, actor and musician, Jack Black as super roadie Eddie Riggs, as well as cameos by some of the biggest names in metal music it's a wild ride in the belly of the beast that is not to be missed by gamers and Metalheads alike.<br> <br><br>Included as a free bonus in the PC version of Brütal Legend are both the Hammer of Infinite Fate and Tears of the Hextadon multiplayer map packs.<br><br><br><strong>Story</strong><br>The vivid and wildly creative world of Brütal Legend is brought to life through a spate of chrome, leather, rocker babes, epic music, fire-breathing/stud-wearing beasts, mountains made of guitar amps, and more. Follow Eddie as he embarks on a tour of epic destruction with an axe, a guitar, and his minions as he commands the power of rock in epic band battles. It’s lighter-flicking awesomeness that will melt your face clean off.<br><br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Brütal Legend’s combat is a combination of classic action slasher and real time strategy mechanics.  Melee and ranged combat come from your double-sided broadaxe and demon-slaying, pyrotechnic-creating guitar.  Add that 1-2 punch to a guitar solo mechanic that can summon objects, buff your teammates, or cripple your opponents, and you have a deep, gratifying core gameplay combat loop that is fun for the hardcore and accessible for the casual.  On top of that, players will journey from Roadie to Rock God by commanding legions of metalheads into Brütal Victory and sending troops charging into battle.<br><br><br><strong>A Streaming Open World</strong><br>Brütal Legend gives you the freedom to walk, drive, or fly anywhere in a fully streaming open world whose art style is inspired by some of the most iconic and hilariously rad metal album covers ever created. Every vista in the beautiful universe of Brütal Legend looks like it was pulled from a Frank Frazetta painting.<br><br><br><strong>Packed With Cameos and Voice Talent</strong><br>Brütal Legend is full of cameos from gods of metal like Lemmy Kilmister, Rob Halford, Lita Ford, and many, many others. It has a MASSIVE metal soundtrack from every era of metal music: 1970’s classic metal to 1980’s hair metal to the scarier cousins of 1990’s metal. And of course, Jack Black pays the ultimate homage to metal as Eddie the Roadie, continuing the theme from the work of his band, Tenacious D and his previous films like School of Rock and High Fidelity.<br><br><br><strong>Multiplayer Mayhem</strong><br>4v4 &quot;skirmish&quot; multiplayer marries action combat with a strategic unit-control mechanic. As the leader of one of the factions in the game, the player will direct his armies in a Battle of the Bands where the trophy is survival. Brütal Legend’s multiplayer is online-enabled, so you can conquer your friends online (broadband connection required for online play).<br><br><br><strong>Music</strong><br>The music in Brütal Legend is truly massive. Made up of 108 of the most rocking tracks from 75 different bands representing every sub-genre of metal, it is something to experience in and of itself."

It’s the first N game on PC since 2004 and we’ve spent those 12 years perfecting the platformer.<br />
<br />
N++ is all about using your momentum to complete levels and get high scores, but in this sci-fi world, there’s a slew of inadvertently homicidal enemy robots trying to prevent you from completing your goal.<br />
<br />
Through the hand-crafted (NOT procedurally generated) levels, you’ll experience platforming at its most intense. Using only your fluid movement, you need to ‘solve’ each level and get to the exit. <br />
<br />
In addition to the lengthy and challenging single player campaign, we’ve packed a ton of features into this one last entry in the N series including:<br />
<br />
-4,340 hand-made levels <br />
-Custom Levels, Level Editor &amp; Global Level Sharing<br />
-Leaderboards and replays for every level (even the ones you make)<br />
-Local Co-op Mode (up to 4 players)<br />
-Local Competitive Mode (up to 4 Players)<br />
-Hardcore Mode, an intense single-player challenge which only the best ninjas will survive<br />
-Intense, hidden Secret challenges to discover<br />
-63 tracks by top electronic artists<br />
-119 different color palettes let you customize the game’s look and keep it fresh every time you play<br />
-and more! <br />

The game will never seek to limit you or restrict your personal play style. <br><br></li><li><strong>Custom design as many characters as you want </strong>and build up a whole squad to fight for you. Characters will grow and become stronger with experience, not just in their stats but their appearance too. <br><br></li><li><strong>Original take on the RTS-RPG hybrid genre.</strong> No &quot;hero&quot; characters with artificially stronger stats than everybody else- Every character and NPC you meet is potentially an equal, and has a name, a life. <br><br></li><li><strong>You are not the chosen one. </strong>You're not great and powerful. You don't have more 'hitpoints' than everyone else. You are not the center of the universe, and you are not special. Unless you work for it.<br><br></li><li><strong>Build a base</strong> where you can research new technologies, upgrade your defences and craft new gear. <br><br></li><li><strong>Purchase and upgrade your own buildings</strong> to use as safe fortified havens when things go bad, or use them to start up a business. <br><br></li><li><strong>Variation and possibilities of gameplay. </strong>Be good, be evil, be a businessman, be a thief, live in a town, live in the desert, travel alone, travel in hordes, build a fortress, raze a city. Devote yourself to freeing slaves, or maybe end up a slave yourself. <br><br></li><li><strong>Dynamic, ever changing world. </strong>Support or hinder whoever you wish, or keep to yourself, the world won't stop moving. This is not just a &quot;game&quot;, you are living and surviving in a simulated world.<br><br></li><li><strong>Get captured by cannibals and eaten alive</strong>, or sold off by slavers and forced to work in the mines. These are not scripted events, just a regular part of this chaotic world that ruins your life by chance. Anything can happen, yet anything can be overcome if you have the strength. <br><br></li><li><strong>Absolutely no Level-scaling.</strong> The world does not level up along with you, and the shops don't change their inventory to only items matching your level. At the start of the game almost everyone will be stronger than you, and survival will always be a struggle. The game won't hold your hand or help you when you're down. <br><br></li><li><strong>Realistic medical system that affects gameplay.</strong> A character with a wounded leg will limp or crawl and slow the party down, wounded arms means you must use your sword one-handed or not at all. Severe injuries will result in amputees needing robotic limb replacements. Blood loss means you can pass out, and the blood will attract predators. A character’s stats are affected by equipment, encumbrance, blood loss, injuries and starvation. <br><br></li><li><strong>Intelligent AI</strong> that allows for characters to reason and work towards long-term goals and desires. Squads work together and carry their wounded to safety. Characters can be setup to take care of micromanagement for you and run production in your base. <br><br></li><li><strong>Aid or oppose the various factions</strong> in the world while striving for the strength and wealth necessary to simply survive in the harsh environment. <br><br></li><li><strong>Independently developed </strong>with no design influences, or alterations dictated by men in gray suits who have never played a game before in their lives. <br><br></li><li><strong>Original game world. </strong>There are no fantasy-knock-off cliches. No magic.</li></ul>"

Experimentation reveals some great new items!<br><br>Through Alchemy: Alchemy allows you to combine several items to create a single, more powerful piece of equipment. While you lose the items used in the alchemy, you gain a powerful new piece of equipment and permanent access to your new item in the Shop! Alchemy can create powerful new weapons and armour but occasionally a Smithing Accident will occur and the smith will create a different item than what you expected!<br><br><strong>The &quot;Soul Breed&quot; system</strong><br>Agarest takes place across 5 generations of heroes, starting with your first character, Leonhardt. During each generation you will build relationships with 3 different female party members, and at the end of each generation's story arc you must choose to marry one of the girls.<br><br>Your choice of marriage partner is restricted to girls who've grown fond of you over a particular generation. Your options are determined by your choices during conversations at certain points of the story.<br><br>The girl you choose as your wife - and the strength of their relationship with you - will determine the abilities of the main character in the next generation of the story.

Divekick’s focused gameplay demonstrates how much depth a single move actually has, and introduces (or reinforces) skills fundamental to the genre: mind games, spacing, timing, and quick reactions.<br><br>At Iron Galaxy we love fighting games. To the average fan, most of what makes them fun is hidden behind a never-ending series of input combinations that they have to memorize. That’s why Divekick has just two buttons: Dive (into the air) makes your character jump straight up. Kick causes your character to fly foot first at a downward angle. If you press Kick on the ground, you can jump away from your opponent. Utilizing these moves, the first hit will win the round, and the player that wins five rounds first wins the game. It’s pure adrenaline, awareness, and outsmarting your enemy. It’s a fighting game deconstructed into its purest form. <br><br><strong>Key Features</strong><br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>14+ Completely unique and original characters, each with their own fighting style and special techniques.  <br></li><li>Includes two extra playable characters: Fencer from Nidhogg and Johnny Gat from Saints Row!<br></li><li>A story for every character in the game, including an intro, ending, and rival battles.

Although the positive impact of this revolution is obvious, every coin has a flipside; for every beneficial device developed with these new materials, so too were advanced weapons and other implements of war.

The phenomenon, which made us who we are today as a team, equally in terms of creative fearlessness and business direction, and helped us pave our further way. Fantastic support from the gaming community was a huge part of that success, so it was without any doubt that this update must be free. We think of the Final Cut as a closing episode to the one-of-a-kind series This War of Mine has been. It will remain precious to our hearts and I don’t know what ideas the future will bring but Final Cut is final by no means. The creative minds in our studio, who were with the game up to this point, started to pursue new challenges. So we're excited about what's coming.”<br><br><a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/app/1601580/Frostpunk_2/?utm_source=twom&amp;utm_medium=steam_page&amp;utm_campaign=fp2_annoucement#game_area_purchase"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer""  ><img src=""https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/282070/extras/FP2_ATW_GIF-EN.gif?t=1639999944"" /></a><h2 class=""bb_tag"">ABOUT THIS WAR OF MINE:</h2><br><img src=""https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/282070/extras/TWOM_1.gif?t=1639999944"" /><br><br>In This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers.

It works by controlling the “random” events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the <strong>AI Storyteller</strong>. There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax.<br><br><strong>Your colonists are not professional settlers</strong> – they’re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You’ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew.<br><br><strong>Each person’s background is tracked and affects how they play.</strong> A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill – but he does that very well.<br><br><strong>Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships.</strong> Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound.<br><br><strong>The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator.</strong> You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season.<br><br><strong>Travel across the planet.</strong> You're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster.<br><br><strong>You can tame and train animals.</strong> Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms.<br><br><strong>People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment.</strong> They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down.<br><br><strong>Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities.</strong> Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous.<br><br><strong>You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent.</strong> A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs.<br><br>And there's much more than that!

298180.0,The Desolate Hope,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/298180/header.jpg?t=1447361659,"On a distant edge of an unknown planet, an abandoned structure sits in silence. Constructed by an unmanned research vessel sent from Earth, the Lun Infinus station was designed to run simulations for a five year period, exploring possibilities of human colonization in the case that Earth became uninhabitable. Developed during an age of ambition and wealth, the project was quickly abandoned when interest faded in the following years. <br><br>The last transmission from Earth occurred more than thirty years ago. The Lun Infinus station contained five sentient computers, Derelicts, built with certain levels of mobility in the case of emergency or need for relocation. Each of these Derelicts was to formulate their own plan for colonization based on thousands of hours of simulations. Given the amount of time that has passed however, the simulations have become very elaborate and bizarre. Meanwhile however, a mysterious computer virus has emerged. The virus of unknown origins has been slowly ravaging the Derelicts. Because of this, more and more CPU processing power has been needed for anti-virus measures, leaving less power for the simulations. Coffee is the last mobile resident of the station, a small service robot who spends his days keeping the station and the Derelicts operational as they perform their daily tasks. Since CPU power is slim, Coffee has been cutting corners to find ways around the virus. By using small subsystems and less vital CPU's scattered through the station in lesser devices, Coffee has designed a line of digital helpers, each simply called a D-Co, or &quot;Digital Counterpart&quot;, to assist him in fighting the virus and keeping the station operational. Eventually the virus gets the best of each D-Co, and Coffee tries to create an improved D-Co using a different CPU. The latest is D-Co 9, built using the code of a simple computer game. Coffee dedicates his own CPU to be used for the main simulations, putting D-Co in charge of moving his body throughout the station, taking care of the needs of the Derelicts, and fighting off virus attacks when they occur.<br><br>GAMEPLAY:<br>The Desolate Hope mixes several gameplay styles. On the station and in the simulations, the game is a platformer. You will shoot enemies, collect powerups and bits (money) and upgrade yourself and your virtual battlers. When you enter a mini-simulation (the old arcade style screens) then the game becomes an 8-bit overhead dungeon crawler. There you can farm money and gain options to customize your battle experiences. When you encounter a virus boss, the game shifts to a JRPG style battle where you must use the mouse to select from your various options to defeat your opponent. Almost everything outside of these battles is aimed at upgrading your abilities and increasing your stats for these fights, they are the real challenge of the game.<br><br>&quot;The Desolate Hope, isn't great just because of its stunning artwork, its gripping sci-fi story, and its coffee pot protagonist. It also packs a triple punch with three distinct gameplay types, each skillfully woven together. The side scrolling action has different platforming elements for each section, the overhead adventure distills fun elements of a classic Zelda (including walls you can walk through or destroy) and the turn-based, RPG-style boss battles are visually mesmerizing and tough.&quot; <strong><a href=""https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://-IndieGames.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""  >-IndieGames.com</a></strong><br><br>&quot;From a gameplay point of view The Desolate Hope mixes platforming with overhead adventure segments and semi turn-based battles. This is already intriguing, but I'm more impressed by its stunning visual style.&quot; <strong><a href=""https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://-mtv.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""  >-mtv.com</a></strong><br><br>&quot;The Desolate Hope is developed by Scott Games and upon booting it up, you will notice the great artwork the game uses.

It might sound like a messy mash up but the game is able to pull it off without a hitch and gamers are in for a unique experience. Offering hours of gameplay, a unique leveling system and a day-and-night cycle.&quot; <strong><a href=""https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://-TheBitBag.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""  >-TheBitBag.com</a></strong><br><br>&quot;The Desolate Hope constantly plays with the very idea of playing a video game. Unlike many modern games, it is hyper-aware of its gameness. There are games inside of games, simulations inside of simulations, mini-games inside of boss fights. And the fact that you’re playing as an AI that developed from a computer game is a very hard wink at the exhaustive level of metagaming that’s going on.&quot; <strong><a href=""https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://-GamesThatExist.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""  >-GamesThatExist.com</a></strong><br><br>&quot;There are plenty of hours of gameplay, a nonlinear path allowing for exploration, and detailed art design.

It also has some incredible visuals, with very detailed character designs and a classic cyberpunk attitude, but not also without a bit of whimsy as well (one derelict has given up on his mission, becoming a toymaker and has begun recreating his simulation with child-like automatons).&quot; <strong><a href=""https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://-GamingSymmetry.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""  >-GamingSymmetry.com</a></strong><br><br>&quot;So after encountering this on Rock Paper Shotgun, I was ready to declare my indie game of the year. Because any game made rock solid out of derelict, insane robots just makes my not-so-inner geek squeal. How insane are the robots? Each is actively running a matrix like test bed, and.... Well, one was building a mining simulator, decided that was too depressing, and started making toys. Another is trying to capture the artistic essence of the soul, but cant seem to make anything run for more than five seconds. The next is attempting to rebuild humanity out of two tissue samples. Then there's the one still running straight, he seems curiously nice... And the last one's dead and frozen. But still drawing power...Then there's the coffee pot. Which is you. Sort of. And hey, bonus! You've got fifteen days to live, and you're the ninth attempt at straightening things out. Good luck!&quot; <strong>-an enthusiastic fan</strong>"

In the air, you're fighting gravity. When you splash down beneath the water, you're fighting your own buoyancy to swing yourself further into the depths.<br />
<br />
The only objective is to collect points, and the only thing that increases your points is swinging swiftly, smoothly and elegantly without hitting anything. As you pick up momentum, you start to glow, the bars you're collecting rise up, the music kicks in, and your trajectory burns a bright red line in the air, drawing huge, beautiful mathematical curves of your arcing flight.<br />

Also the name is a pun, so that's cool."

319510.0,Five Nights at Freddy's,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/319510/header.jpg?t=1579635996,"Welcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.<br><br>From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!<br><br>Can you survive five nights at Freddy's?<br><br><i>&quot;For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.&quot;</i> <strong>-Joel Couture <a href=""http://IndieGameMag.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer""  >IndieGameMag.com</a> </strong><br><br>This game was created using Clickteam Fusion!"

In an entirely frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. You face the task of building the last city on Earth and securing the means necessary for your community to survive. <br><br>Optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management will consume most of the ruler’s time, at some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its history and present state.<br><br>What decisions will you make to ensure the survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And who will you become in the process?<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>MAKE THE LAW</strong></h2>Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life.

Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. Leadership can be a burden.<br><img src=""https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/323190/extras/FP_STEAM_GIF_03.gif?t=1642496017"" /><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES</strong></h2>Survival demands progress.

Now surviving as a reclusive mercenary on the edge of a corrupted world, the formidable warrior must again wield a devastating combination of guns, blades, magic and wit to strike down the demonic legions overwhelming the world. Battle alongside allies online in four-player co-op or go it alone in spectacular procedurally-generated landscapes to complete daring missions and collect powerful new weapons, armor, and arcane relics of legend.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">STORY</h2>Five years have passed since Lo Wang shattered the alliance between his deceitful former boss and the ancient gods of the shadow realm. Despite noble intentions, Lo Wang’s efforts to annihilate the darkness corrupted the world, creating a strange and savage new order where humans and demons live side by side. <br><br>The once feared warrior now lives in the shifting wildlands outside the reach of his enemies and the neon glow of Zilla’s cybernetic metropolis, scratching out a meager existence as a hired sword for the local Yakuza clans. When a simple mission goes wrong, Lo Wang is drawn into a volatile conflict between a brilliant young scientist, his nemesis Orochi Zilla, and the demonic forces that have become unsettled in our world.

Procedurally generated landscapes and paths bring new twists and turns to once familiar terrain and routine missions. <br><br><strong>Brutal Damage System:</strong> Choose your weapon based on the situation at hand and then dismantle everything that stands in your path with an advanced gore system. Use precision blade strikes to separate limbs and heads or switch to heavy ordinance and blow a hole right through colossal beasts.<br><br><strong>Custom Upgrade System:</strong> Upgrade weapons in your arsenal with up to three stones at once to improve performance or augment them with devastating elemental effects. Collect karma, amulets, and armor to enhance Lo Wang’s power and shift his death-dealing artistry into overdrive.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Shadow Warrior Series</h2><br>The Shadow Warrior series started back in the 90s with Shadow Warrior Classic that was remastered and released on Steam by Devolver Digital and 3D Realms as Shadow Warrior Classic Redux.

Чтобы разгадать, что же с ним случилось, Семену придется получше узнать местных обитателей (а может, даже встретить любовь), разобраться в лабиринтах сложных человеческих взаимоотношений и своих собственных проблемах, решить загадки лагеря.

The Steam version adds various Deluxe features like achievements, difficulty level customization and various play modes (e.g. a story mode allowing to save and restore games, a weekly challenge game, an exploration mode and more). ADOM has been in development since 1994. In 2012 its development was revitalized with an immensely successful crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo, now allowing us to offer ADOM both with ASCII and graphical modes enabling you to choose freely. <br><br>ADOM is primarily known for being the first roguelike to include vibrant towns, NPC dialog, and quests, but it offers more than just a rich story line in a complex fantasy world: <br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>a huge game world with hundreds of locations such as towns, randomized dungeons, elemental temples, graveyards, ancient ruins, towers and other secrets <br></li><li>loads of races (dwarves, drakelings, mist elves, hurthlings, orcs, trolls, ratlings and many others) and even more classes (fighters, elementalists, assassins, chaos knights, duelists and much more) allowing for infinite play styles <br></li><li>hundreds of monsters and items, many with enhanced random features <br></li><li>a corruption system forcing you to balance lust for power with fear of damnation (corruptions slowly transform you into a vile monster but at the same time grant inhuman benefits - most of the time) <br></li><li>spells, prayers, mindcraft, alchemy, crafting and more <br></li><li>dozens of quests and branching story lines <br></li><li>numerous wildly different endings that might alter reality itself (simply drive Chaos away or slay a god or even become an immortal yourself, and others more)!<br></li><li>various game modes (story mode to be able to load and save games, challenge mode to face peculiar weekly challenges, exploration mode for a free wand of wishing and more)<br></li><li>various customization options (turning hunger off, turning corruption off, modifying monster difficulty or treasure rates)</li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">ABOUT THE ANCIENT DOMAINS OF MYSTERY</h2><br>Deep in the mountainous ranges of the Drakalor Chain, Chaos has broken through into Ancardia and it's up to you to decide the fate of the entire realm. You control a single character with a wildy varying set of skills, talents, spells and other abilities. Customized equipment makes each race/class combination a very different experience. Explore a mostly randomized underworld, fight monsters, loot treasures and uncover the many secrets lurking in the world of Ancardia. <br><br>Join a generation of gamers in playing a remastered version of this classic rogue-like!<br><br>With an overhaul of the graphics, music, new playable races and classes, over 400 monsters, tens of thousands of items, crafting, magic, religion, corruption, randomized dungeons and so much more, this reimagined version is one of the most in-depth roguelikes on the planet. <br><br>So, come join us as we return to Ancardia and choose your fate.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">ABOUT ADOM ON STEAM</h2><br>ADOM on Steam takes ADOM gameplay to the next level by introducing the following features (among others): <br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>70+ achievements, <br></li><li>game customization features (e.g. turning corruption off, increasing treasure rates adjusting monster lethality),<br></li><li>ghost creation and exchange between players - be haunted by dead player characters and try to win their treasures,<br></li><li>story mode - save and reload your games,<br></li><li>exploration mode - use a wand of wishes to discover completely new sides of the game,<br></li><li>challenge mode - try to score highest under complex conditions in weekly challenge games,<br></li><li>shared and global highscores, <br></li><li>point-based character generation, <br></li><li>star sign selection,<br></li><li>and so much more.</li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">THE FUTURE OF ADOM</h2><br>Is ADOM a complete game? Yes, a very complete game. A multitude of endings, varied approaches to game play, thousands of starting combinations and an extensive storyline filled with endless details makes for an extremely satisfying experience that justly positions ADOM as one of the big five foundational roguelike games.<br><br>Is ADOM a finished game? No. As long as there is interest in the game we will continue to evolve and enhance it. In this respect ADOM differs from many other games on Steam in the best tradition of roguelike classics: We will continue to add both UI enhancements and new content to the core game in order to make it the most complete RPG ever.

342200.0,MechWarrior Online™ Solaris 7,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/342200/header.jpg?t=1642721774,"<strong><h2 class=""bb_tag"">MechWarrior Online™ Solaris 7</h2></strong><br><br>MechWarrior Online™ Solaris 7 is a tactical, 'Mech-based online shooter set in the vast BattleTech Universe. In the 31st century the battlefields are dominated by immense and powerful mechanized units called BattleMechs. Join the ranks of elite operators tasked with piloting these war machines. Choose your path to becoming the most feared MechWarrior in the Inner Sphere, fighting for battlefield supremacy against other players.<br><br>Enter the Solaris Arena.<br><br>The newest addition to MechWarrior online™, Solaris 7, features 1 vs 1 and 2 vs 2 Mech Combat across 7 Divisions. Choose your BattleMech wisely, each of the 7 Divisions has a limited roster of BattleMechs available based on the Mech’s performance capabilities on the battlefield. Take a Patron Contract, pick up sponsors, and earn accolades as you climb to the top of the Divisions Leaderboards. Solaris 7 features 5 maps tailored for intense Mech Combat.<br><br>Quick Play is where you'll find fast action, fielding a single 'Mech in team-based game modes and maps. Unlike Faction Play, Quick Play matches do not influence the layout of Inner Sphere territories; these battles are fought purely for rewards and glory.<br><br>In Faction Play you will field 4 ‘Mechs per match, lending your skills and allegiance to the Faction of your choosing in prolonged team-based engagements, conquering and defending planets in their name to earn rewards and expand your Faction's territory across the Inner Sphere.<br><br><strong><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Gameplay </h2></strong><br>Piloting a 'Mech to victory requires a mastery of tactical positioning, teamwork, and firing discipline. Strike out as a Lone Wolf or seek out one of the many player-controlled Units and fight under the banners of powerful galactic empires for prestige, wealth, or nothing more than the sheer thrill of battle. <br><br><strong>Next Gen Mobility </strong> - By the 31st century, tanks have evolved to take on humanoid shape, their treads replaced with nimble legs. Like modern tanks, 'Mechs move their upper torso and weapons independently of their legs offering unparalleled mobility while exchanging fire. Depending on their size, BattleMechs travel at vastly different speeds and offer different systems like jump jets to aid in their locomotion.<br><br><strong>Make Every Shot Count </strong> - Pilots must balance mobility and damage output against the amount of heat generated from their weapons fire and 'Mech operation, lest they risk the temporary loss of power that comes when a 'Mech overheats. Firing all weapons simultaneously (known as an Alpha Strike) can be the quickest way to devastate an opponent, but may leave a 'Mech helpless against its enemies if the heat sinks can't handle the stress.<br><br><strong>Fight Smart </strong> - 'Mechs possess both external armor and strong internal structural elements to help minimize the chance of a 'quick kill'. As a result, pilots must treat each encounter with the utmost attention and awareness, prioritizing weaker or more critical components before delivering the killing blow. Communication among teammates and the effective use of targeting systems can help to identify vulnerable 'Mechs and components.<br><br><strong>Teamwork is the Difference </strong> - Targeting a 'Mech will automatically allow your teammates to achieve their own lock, allowing them to ascertain vital location data, armor status, and loadout details for the targeted enemy. Information Warfare can be a vital component for victory, providing attack-focused allies with the necessary information to tear their opponents to pieces.<br><br><strong>Information Warfare</strong> - While fast-moving scouts feed target and tactical information back to the main battle group and the team commander, long-range Support and heavy-hitting Brawler and Assault ‘Mechs will use this information to position themselves for the perfect strike. Pilots can also shield themselves and allies from enemy sensors and weapons fire using various counter measures. It is up to each pilot to customize their BattleMech loadout to fulfill their desired role. <br><br><strong>Find the perfect 'Mech </strong>- Hundreds of unique 'Mechs are available, offering a wide range of strengths and weaknesses. Smaller 'Mechs should never stop moving, and can rely on their sheer speed to overwhelm heavier opponents. Larger 'Mechs move slow and deliberate but can stand toe-to-toe with other large opponents. Acquire and test different 'Mechs to find those that best suit your play style.<br><br><strong>Choose Your Allegiance </strong> - Work for the powerful empires of the galaxy to earn their loyalty and spread their influence across the stars. Band together with other pilots using the Looking For Group feature, or use the Faction Chat feature to coordinate offensive and defensive strategies to capture or defend worlds and shift the balance of power.<br><br><strong>Get Rewarded </strong> - Pilots earn ComStar Bills (C-Bills) from playing matches and completing faction contracts, which can be used to purchase new 'Mechs and equipment.<br><br>Certain items can only be purchased using premium 'Mech Credits (MC). MC can either be purchased directly via real world money or acquired in smaller increments in-game by earning reputation with a Faction in Faction Play, or as rewards from participating in special Events.<br><br>'Mech Experience (XP) gained during combat is applied to the 'Mech used during that match, and can be used to unlock improvements to various BattleMech systems.<br><br>MechWarrior Online™ also includes a host of achievements to unlock that will challenge even the most skilled players."

Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled!

348200.0,Nimble Writer,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/348200/header.jpg?t=1613668755,"Nimble Writer is a general-purpose tool for writing stories, be it short fiction stories or even complete novels or books. It focuses on being distraction-free, simple, and fully customizable.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Principles</h2>We built Nimble Writer with a couple principles in mind to make it stand out as a primary application for authors:<br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Writing without distractions or worrying about formatting.<br></li><li>Stay more organized with many useful organizational features.<br></li><li>Materials of reference (such as photos, drawings, scribbles of text, character information, and much more) are available at your fingertips.<br></li><li>Don't have any limitations to the default array of features. This means full customization, with a fully customizable and scriptable interface. Turn off features you don't need, change the entire look and feel of your writing environment, and much more.</li></ul><br>If you are used to writing stories in applications such as Word or other regular office tools, you'll find that Nimble Writer will be able to help you organize bundles of stories and notes together much simpler and faster. In addition, Nimble Writer is able to import some of those old documents and convert them into the Nimble Writer format.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Advantages over traditional software</h2>Traditional writing software such as Word, Open Office or Google Docs are made just for the purpose of writing, so they don't have anything that helps story writers manage their notes and reference material, and neither does it offer much customization. They don't have any kind of chapter management either. Nimble Writer has all of those things, making it a much more productive choice for story writing.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Steam's advantages</h2>With Nimble Writer's presence on Steam we can use the power that Steam's platform brings us, such as <strong>Steam Cloud</strong>. This means that you will be able to save your stories and notes entirely on Steam's cloud servers, so that you can load up your stories on another computer as well, just as easy!<br><br>Don't forget about <strong>Steam Workshop</strong>! With the implementation of the Workshop, you'll be able to share interface themes and addons with the world, or just to customize the app with other people's addons! Share creativity!"

Save and invest, steal and extort, arrest and get arrested – in single-player and multiplayer, with ranks and ladders, team mode and spectator mode. Featuring seasonal content updates, regular tournaments, item drops, full support of Steam Community Market – and more!<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>HOW DO YOU PLAY THIS GAME?</strong></h2><br>Gremlins, Inc. is designed for up to 6 players, in <u>multiplayer</u> or in <u>single-player</u> mode (with AI bots). Each player has 6 cards on their hand (replenished from the same deck) and uses them either to move around the playing field or to perform different game actions. There is a lot of interaction with other players, and duels are significantly different from 3-player or 4-player games. You can play until a certain score limit, or until agreed number of rounds, or for time limit. The game offers both <u>custom</u> and <u>ranked</u> sessions (with matchmaking by rating).<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>CAN YOU PLAY IN TEAMS OR JUST WATCH?</strong></h2><br>Yes, you can! In addition to <u>custom sessions</u> (where you define the parameters of the session and may optionally set filters for those who can join you) and password-protected <u>private sessions</u> (so that you and your friends can play undisturbed), the game offers <u>team mode</u> (2x2, 3x3, or 2x2x2) with teams of human players and/or AI bots. Gremlins, Inc. also supports a built-in <u>spectator mode</u>, which allows you to watch sessions of other players right from inside of the game, sharing your emotions with players and other spectators through messages and emoticons.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>CAN YOU PLAY THIS GAME OFFLINE?</strong></h2><br>Certainly! When you buy this game, you get 2 products in your Steam Library: <u><strong>Gremlins, Inc.</strong></u> – the edition that is playable online in single-player and multiplayer modes, with full support of item drops and Steam Workshop; and <u><strong>Gremlins vs Automatons</strong></u> – the edition that is playable offline in single-player mode, without any connection to our server whatsoever.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO PLAY ONE SESSION?</strong></h2><br>The game offers different session settings to make them fit your available time, and single-player mode offers automatic <u>SAVE / LOAD</u> function at every turn so that you can take a break whenever you want (while multiplayer mode offers re-connect functionality as long as the session is still in progress). A quick duel for 20 score points with a fast timer can finish in under 20 minutes, while a 4-player session for 60 rounds can last for 2 hours or more.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM STRATEGIES?</strong></h2><br>There are different types of cards in the game (permanent, regular, secret and criminal) and as each card can be used either to move or for action, you will develop both <u>short-term</u> and <u>long-term</u> strategies for making the most out of where you are, and what you currently have in your hand. Normally, you spend half of your game time accumulating resources and building the foundation for the end-game, and the other half trying to control the progress of your opponents (stealing, arresting, initiating player conflicts, and so on). The more you play, the more new strategies you will discover – especially when combining the effects of several cards played in a combination.<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/369990/extras/StorePage07.png?t=1643379992"" /><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>MAKE DECISIONS, PLAN YOUR MOVES</strong></h2><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>This is an intense <u>strategy game</u>: make decisions at every round!

No, no and no – you couldn’t be further from the truth! What you carry around is a whole gremlin town packed into this tiny mechanism: a town with its own bank, its own casino… and even its own jail! Gremlins are the microscopic creatures that inhabit any mechanism that they can possibly infiltrate. If a watch or a telescope malfunctions, then it’s probably due to gremlins who took up a residence there.<br><br>More than anything in life, gremlins value <strong>money</strong>, <strong>political power</strong> and <strong>prestige</strong>: prestige that one can claim after completing some sort of a grandiose engineering project. Aside from working on their own projects, gremlins mostly spend their time preventing other gremlins from building something even more grandiose. This they achieve through bribing officials and lying to the electorate, as well through stealing from their competitors - and outright arresting them.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>A DISCLAIMER (JUST IN CASE)</strong></h2><br>We felt it important to note that Gremlins, Inc. is not a free-to-play game. Also, this is not a CCG or TCG: you do not need to buy boosters or packs; in every session the game offers the same deck to every player, and everyone's chances are equal.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>OUR DLC POLICY</strong></h2><br>We released Gremlins, Inc. on Steam in Early Access at the end of 2015. Since then, we released over 100 game updates as we continue to add more content and more features as well as improve the overall player experience.<br><br>This is what we typically add to the game with the regular free updates of the game:<br><br>* new features and new mechanics<br>* new cards and new Misfortunes<br>* new music tracks and new game themes (for special occasions such as Lunar New Year)<br><br>These seasonal updates are available to every owner of the game for FREE, regardless of DLC ownership.<br><br>And this is what we release as paid DLC:<br><br>* new character portraits and player tokens<br>* new music tracks and new game themes<br>* new trails, frames and emoticons<br>* new single-player content<br><br>If you enjoy Gremlins, Inc., you can support our development efforts by purchasing its DLC. However, there is absolutely no pressure to own any of the extra content in order to play the game or compete in the tournaments.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>STEAM COMMUNITY MARKET, CRAFTING AND ITEM STORE</strong></h2><br>Gremlins, Inc. features <u>in-game items</u> and fully supports <a href=""http://steamcommunity.com/market/search?appid=369990"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer""  >Steam Community Market</a>. While playing the game, certain actions will trigger random chest drops with items of varying rarity: it could be a new emoticon, a new profile background, a new music track, or one of the dozens of other cosmetic items. These items are FREE, yours to use or trade on <a href=""http://steamcommunity.com/market/search?appid=369990"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer""  >Steam Community Market</a>. We, the developer, do not engage in the direct sales of any drop items; only players can trade them.<br><br>The game also supports <u>crafting</u>: once you find a blueprint of a specific item, you can create as many such items as you wish, as long as you have the required number of charges (you get charges when you convert other in-game items that you do not want, or have multiple copies of). Finally, the game has its own <a href=""http://store.steampowered.com/itemstore/369990/browse/?filter=all"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer""  >Steam Item Store</a> where we sell a very small number of unique items that influence the item meta-game (but they have no effect on the game mechanics).<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/369990/extras/SteamStore21.png?t=1643379992"" /><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>ONLINE &amp; OFFLINE VERSIONS</strong></h2><br>Gremlins, Inc. was designed as a digital board game with the multiplayer mode at its heart. However, this is not to say that we don't like single-player – we do, and there's a separate section with the single-player challenges as well as the mode where you can create any custom single-player session that you like! One of the products that you receive with this game, <strong><u>Gremlins, Inc.</u></strong>, features both single-player and multiplayer modes, and requires that your game client is connected to both Steam and the game's server at all times – in order to support item drops, Steam Community Market and Steam Workshop. The other product that is included with the game, <strong><u>Gremlins vs Automatons</u></strong>, features single-player mode and is designed specifically to be played offline."

Explore vast landscapes of dense forest and open plains, traverse treacherous mountains and wade through dark swamps where horrors lurk. Hidden within are ruins that hold insight as to what came before. Through it all, keep in mind there is only one goal: survive. <br><br>There is little in the way of hand holding or ulterior precepts to alter play styles or purpose. It's kill or be killed. In the end, the only one you can trust is yourself.

Dinosaurs in Survival mode progress through several life stages, starting out small and vulnerable.

The game represents a unique and unforgettable experience as it transports players in a weird town which crouches, ominous, in the far reaches of an ancient steppe. It was once a small drover settlement, huddled around a monstrous abattoir—but something about the butchery it was near has changed it. It has developed an odd social structure over the course of several generations. It could have quietly continued along its weird way, but a sudden outbreak of an unknown and inevitably lethal disease has decimated the citizens. Prayers did not help. Science did not help. So, finally, they have turned to outsiders for help: three of them enter the town in hope of finding a cure or—failing that—an explanation. The first outsider was a ruthless investigator, assigned by local authorities. The second is a far-sighted Ripper who has used his extraordinary abilities to gain a reputation as an ingenious surgeon, who has come to the town in search of his father's terrible heritage. The third—and last—outsider is an eccentric girl rumored to have mystic healing abilities; she may become the town's salvation were it not for the constant fear that plagues her, the memory of the horrors of her recent past.<br><br>On the surface, Pathologic is a first person horror adventure game where you control one of three &quot;heroes.&quot; Dig deeper, however, and you’ll find an experience that will affect your emotional and psychological state. In the world of Pathologic you’ll find yourself in situations where morals and good deeds are meaningless in the face of raw despair and endless need. Talk to the denizens of the town and decide for yourself if you wish to ease someone else’s pain or save every bit of precious medicine to protect yourself from the invisible and inexorable plague.

You look up, startled. That melody… Was that a piano? It sounded just like her… But, no—that would be impossible. She’s gone. They’re all gone.<br />

A spin-off from the most popular open-world Early Access game on Steam <i>ARK: Survival Evolved</i>, <strong><i>ARK: Survival of the Fittest (SotF)</i></strong> pits up to 72 combatants in an action-packed struggle for survival where players are ultimately pushed into an epic final showdown where only one “Tribe” will make it out alive.<br> <br>Survivors can form one- to six-person Tribes with the options to choose Unofficial and Official (Ranked) servers, and a variety of game-lengths and sizes in which to play.

Dedicated eSport ranking, matchmaking, reward, and tournament features make <strong><i>ARK: SotF</i></strong> readily accessible to all players.<br> <br>Balanced for intense competition, contestants begin in a neutral staging area where they can communicate pre-game, strategize, or talk trash. After a count-down, they dramatically descend from the sky onto the ARK in a circular formation via beams of light. There is a cache of valuable items in the center – do survivors dash for the goods and fight it out, do they run into the forest and hide, search for Dinosaurs to rapidly build their army, or do they freeze up from the sheer terror of death? A continually shrinking “ring of death” forces contestants ever closer together over time.

Set in the same universe as the first game, but with different characters and a different setting, Outlast 2 is a twisted new journey into the depths of the human mind and its dark secrets.  <br />
<br />
Outlast 2 introduces you to Sullivan Knoth and his followers,  who left our wicked world behind to give birth to Temple Gate, a town, deep in the wilderness and hidden from civilization. Knoth and his flock are preparing for the tribulations of the end of times and you’re right in the thick of it.<br />
<br />
You are Blake Langermann, a cameraman working with your wife, Lynn. The two of you are investigative journalists willing to take risks and dig deep to uncover the stories no one else will dare touch.  <br />
<br />
You're following a trail of clues that started with the seemingly impossible murder of a pregnant woman known only as Jane Doe.  <br />
The investigation has lead you miles into the Arizona desert, to a darkness so deep that no one could shed light upon it, and a corruption so profound that going mad may be the only sane thing to do."

Additionally, players will also be able to choose from a list of regiments that fought in each battle as well as what rank to fight as, whether they want to slog it out as a lowly private, or if you want to orchestrate the carnage and mayhem as a major general. <br><br>⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀<img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/424030/extras/WoR_1.gif?t=1642821549"" /><br><br>Uniforms and bodily features will all be customizable for other players to see as you march and fight in the lines of battle according to the tactics of the period.

Send out new orders to the regiments to move forward, or fall back - all in real time. The orders will move down the chain of command, to the Colonels, Majors, down to the Captains in charge of the individual regiments, all of whom have the option to follow the orders of their trusted commander, or rebel against his wishes and fight as you see fit. <br><br>⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀<img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/424030/extras/WoR_3.gif?t=1642821549"" /><br><br>Each map contains a period reconstruction of the buildings, farms, forests, roads, and rocks as they were in 1862 so players can fight through the streets of Harper's Ferry, in the wooded heights of Fox's Gap at South Mountain, or in the cornfields and Bloody Lanes of Antietam. Players can feel the whiz of deadly shot and shell fly by their bodies, or hit their comrades or themselves as they scream in a bloody hail from their wounds.

As all plans are subject to change, there is a great chance that the list will also end up changing, however.<br>The order of the roadmap is also subject to change as the development moves ahead. Some things listed may arrive a great deal sooner or later than what their listing order indicates.<br><br><strong>1. Bug fixes, stability improvements:</strong> This will be an ongoing focus throughout the development of the game. An alpha is never without its bugs. New content rarely comes without its fair share of bugs and issues required to fix up.<br><br><strong>2. Performance improvements:</strong> We are well aware of the performance of the alpha is needing to be improved - especially at higher playercounts. Major programming work is currently going into reworking the most expensive part of the game at high playercounts. Once finished you should all be experiencing much better framerates on populated servers.<br><br><strong>3. Expanded server moderation tools:</strong> This will allow server administrators more control to manage and configure their server using commands such as: kick,ban,change map, change skirmish area, change weather and time of day.<br><br><strong>4. Improved melee:</strong> Melee is going to be receiving a much needed overhaul, including the availability of a parry move and animation kill sequences between two players (“kill-moves”) to increase the visual fidelity of close quarter fighting.<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/424030/extras/Melee_650.jpg?t=1642821549"" /><br><br><strong>5.

Historical Battles mode:</strong> Besides the quicker Skirmish mode, the largest and main game mode intended for the game, known as Historical Battles, would open up the entirety of the 4x4 km battlefields for more of a complete playthrough, with a moving frontline consisting of several capture areas. This will also entail the use of the full chain of command where players take the part of Generals, using maps and couriers to direct troops across the huge battlefield.<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/424030/extras/Skirmish_7_Maryland_Heights_650.jpg?t=1642821549"" /><br><br><strong>7. Generals:</strong> The chain of command on the battlefield will be expanded with the addition of generals. Generals bring a tactical overview to the battle that all other classes lack, helping to command the troops when using the historical battles mode, helping to bring some order to the chaos of war.<br><br><strong>8. Cavalry:</strong> Horses are to be implemented for both cavalry units, moving artillery pieces, as well as for the high command and their couriers. The cavalry was still an important branch of the armies of the period considering the changes in technology, acting as reconnaissance and quick response units as understandings for their use developed over the period of the war.<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/424030/extras/Cavalry_650.jpg?t=1642821549"" /><br><br><strong>9. Final Release:</strong> Once the above features have been finished, we will be at the point that we would be just about ready for full release of the game to all and sundry! This final release would also be the point that those that had backed us originally would be getting their promised physical and digital goods. While we cannot give any definite date as to when we might get to release, we inch closer every day!"

Perhaps you want to band together and try to take on Jason as a group? Maybe you and a friend decide to fix the boat on the lake and escape while leaving everyone else to their fate? There are endless opportunities to survive the night, but every choice has a consequence. <br><br>Friday the 13th: The Game will continually set the pace of change, giving you unfamiliar surroundings while Jason Voorhees looks for his latest victim. No single strategy will ever be reliable, forcing players to adapt and change each time they begin their long night in Camp Blood! Be wary, you never know when or where Jason is going to strike!<br><br><strong>Play as the Counselors!</strong><br><br>We all remember the various tropes from Friday the 13th, and the game will be no exception! Each counselor type will have strengths and weaknesses, affording players the chance to excel in certain situations. Find the counselor that best suits your play style, or come up with various strategies to win against Jason! Players will have the chance to continually update and improve their characters through unlocks, customization and improvement! The more you play, the more you adapt and become a better all-around counselor!<br><br><strong>Camp Crystal Lake in All Its Glory!</strong><br><br>Mirroring Camp Crystal Lake from the Friday the 13th series, players will try to survive not only in the iconic Camp Crystal Lake, but surrounding area. Iconic locations from the movies, like Higgins Haven will also serve as stalking grounds for Jason and his prey. <br><br>Players will be given a large, open area in which to explore as they attempt to hide from certain death! Each gameplay session will fundamentally change the scenario, never affording players the opportunity to learn patterns or figure out where helpful items may be lying. With each movie giving a different feeling to the campgrounds, Friday the 13th: The Game gives you new and challenging situations every time you enter the woods!<br><br><strong>Your Crystal Lake Database</strong><br><br>Friday the 13th: The Game will feature a progressive unlock system unified to your account. The longer you play, the more you'll unlock from counselor customization to new Jason Voorhees costumes seen in the movies! Besides giving you personalized camp counselors, you'll be able to unlock secrets within Camp Crystal Lake, exploring the mystery surrounding Jason Voorhees and the grounds he patrols!<br><br><strong>Be Kind. Rewind.</strong> <br><br>Every aspect of Friday the 13th: The Game<br>is drawn straight from movies you know and love. We’ve carefully crafted this world to remind you of<br>everything you remember about Friday the 13th, right down to the visual fidelity of the 80’s. This is exactly how you remember it."

Made by card gamers for card gamers. <br />
<br />
Shadowverse is Japan's #1 strategic card game!<br />
- There are millions of Shadowverse battles every day, and a multitude of ways to play<br />
- Easy to get into, thanks to a singleplayer story mode, free card packs for new players, and bonuses every day <br />
- Battles are finely balanced, with less RNG than other card games, and balance adjustments take place every month<br />
- New card expansions are released every three months, unleashing new deck-building strategies and battle tactics<br />
- We’ve got a great community of 22 million players and counting, with tournaments and esports broadcasts every week and support for streamers <br />
- Featuring beautiful art and animations and fully voiced cards and story<br />
<br />
<br />
- A multitude of ways to play: <br />
With eight different leader classes, Shadowverse gives you unparalleled freedom to create your own deck strategies. Will you play as Urias and unleash your Vengeance when your health is depleted? Or will you select Isabelle, whose spells power up the cards in your hand? Will you go all in with an aggro deck, or try to contain the board with a control deck? Or will you try to sneak in some sublimely ingenious combos? It’s entirely up to you. <br />
<br />
- Easy to get into: <br />
Learn the basics by playing through our extensive singleplayer story mode before taking on other players in our multiplayer modes. Be sure to pick up your free card packs after you’ve finished playing through the tutorial – just go to your Crate from the main menu to pick them up. And bonuses and daily missions help you unlock new card packs every day so it won’t be long before you have a deck that is capable of competing with the very best. <br />
<br />
- Finely balanced: <br />
There’s less RNG in Shadowverse than other card games, making it supremely balanced: you’ll need to trust your judgement not your luck if you are to come out on top. And we make balance adjustments every month to make sure that no one card or deck type becomes too dominant.<br />
<br />
- New card expansions released regularly: <br />
New card expansions are added every three months to make sure the meta never gets stale. And every single expansion unleashes new deck-building strategies and battle tactics, and even new leader classes and game modes. We’re in this for the long haul and we hope you will be too.<br />
<br />
- Beautiful art:<br />
All of the cards in Shadowverse feature fantastic art by some of Japan’s finest artists, and every single card is available as an animated version. Every card is also fully-voiced, in English and Japanese, as is the singleplayer storyline. <br />
<br />
- A great community:<br />
And last but not least, we have some amazing fans. We’ve got memes, we’ve got streams, and we have much, much more to offer than the average card game. Community tournaments and e-sports broadcasts take place every week, and there are a ton of deck-building resources online in case you get stuck. Millions of card gamers can’t be wrong – why don’t you join them?"

As the players eventually settle the entire orbit, they can start finding ways to travel to the planet’s moons and someday all the way to other planets and distant star systems. The still unoccupied universe of Starbase offers players the chance to take part in the building of the galaxy and in discovering what will be the first steps in the twilight of space travel. <br><br>Early Access allows the players to design, build &amp; modify spaceships, explore the universe, form social connections, and earn money by mining, gathering, crafting and selling resources. The players can start building their home stations and begin the expansion of the Starbase universe together with the developers.<br><br>Starbase launches into Early Access in a clear alpha stage, however the core features are well established and there's fun to be had for sure.

Depending on your play-style, you can play it fast or slow. Either way it can be fun for hundreds of hours!<br />
<br />
<br />
In the year 9001, humans destroyed all habitable planets in the known universe. On the last planet, they managed to create a space dimension device. With this device, they were able to travel to a different dimension. The world of Idling to Rule the Gods.<br />
In the first habitable planet they found, they noticed the world works different than the known universe. It is ruled by gods. Soon after, Hyperion, the first god found the humans and fought them. After a long lasting fight, all humans but you – the player – died. While surviving the whole time, you developed your own special ability: to create shadow clones.<br />
<br />
The game starts here.<br />
You create shadow clones, they train, learn skills and fight monsters for you, while you absorb their power until you are powerful enough to beat the first god “Hyperion”. After beating Hyperion, you find many, much stronger gods. To be able to defeat all of them, you must find various ways to become more powerful. You rebirth, create your own monuments, train pets and fight ultimate beings.<br />
<br />
<br />
You feel like doing nothing?<br />
Even though you want to become rich?<br />
You are lazy?<br />
But you want to be stronger?<br />
You have two left hands?<br />
But you want to create something new?<br />
<br />
Then fear not!<br />
The solution is here.<br />
<br />
You will become divine!<br />
You will become strong. Stronger than gods!<br />
You will create anything. More than anyone ever has!<br />
In the virtual world of Idling to Rule the Gods.<br />
<br />
What you have to do for this?<br />
Not much!<br />
Just sit any play: &quot;Idling to rule the Gods&quot;.<br />
The game where you can create your own universe!<br />
You will become stronger when not even playing!<br />
Just go offline and sleep and wake up much stronger."

You wake up in unknown surroundings to the sound of the Game Master’s unfamiliar voice. Surrounded by five others, a third of your group have been infected with the Game Master’s deadly virus and tasked with taking down the other innocent players. Innocents must stay alert, traverse the three zones and escape through the safety hatch as the infected try to pick you off one by one.<br><br>When playing as an innocent, you’ll progress through the map and come across items to help you survive as you advance towards the exit. However, you will need to decide which of these are most valuable to you, and whether to collaborate or fight with other players to get your hands on them. Every decision gives you more information on your teammates and what side they’re likely to be on. <br><br>A test of strategy and skill, innocents must work together to gather weapons, secure objectives and vote out those suspected of infection to strengthen their chances of survival. But the environment has been setup to cause conflict amongst the group, creating doubt about the true intentions of players. The infected will be busy collecting blood and trying to cover up their sabotage attempts, whilst the innocents will be keeping an eye out for suspicious behaviour and attempting to make alliances with those they think they can trust. <br><br>At the end of each zone, a blackout period occurs, allowing the infected players to transform into their terror form and attack. You’ll need this form to kill innocent players. In terror form you’re faster, stronger, and have better vision than your innocent victims and with an array of intense killing animations you’ll be able to create some frightening but also amusing gameplay!<br><br><br>Deceit combines the frenzy of fast paced combat mixed with strategic gameplay, and of course the psychological mind games of determining who you can trust."

Perhaps you would love to have an orchard with apples, strawberries or cucumbers? In Farm Manager 2018 you can have more than 20 different crops that you can cultivate by hand or using machines, where each harvest has a precise expiration date. Before you plant your seedlings, first remember about the proper preparation of the land for cultivation. Watch your plants as they grow from green, fragile seedlings up to the state of flowering, ripening and ready for harvest. Do not forget about watering in periods of drought. If plants are not cared for properly they become ill, lose their quality and eventually die.<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/495560/extras/Machines_EN.jpg?t=1644481274"" /><br>On the machine market you can buy both new and used agricultural machinery.

Be sure to provide them with adequate animal feed and skilled caregivers. Raise newly purchased animals before they begin to produce eggs or milk. Bees love buckwheat and colza, so create fields with suitable plants nearby.

So, we asked: “What do you feel makes the game stand out?”<br>We really liked what Misery wrote, so here’s a summary:<br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>1. the Dungeon Generation<br></li><li>2. It uses a ton of traditional roguelike concepts, but in non-annoying ways<br>The fact that the game FEELS like a traditional one while still being real-time is a pretty major thing as far as I see it.<br></li><li>3. The combat is pretty fun, yeah<br>Lots going on there, particularly once things like potions and staves or whatever are thrown into the mix. Feels more tactical than the usual &quot;shoot everything&quot; sort.<br></li><li>4. Pausing the game<br>Being able to pause the game and deal with your inventory, use items, and examine things, without actually leaving the game screen, that's a big one. It all really opens up a lot of options for tactical play.<br></li><li>5. The Puzzles<br>[The puzzles] feel like the sorts that the old Zelda games used to use. That same satisfaction from that is here overall.<br></li><li>6. The hub floors<br>Ended up being a great feature.<br></li><li>7. The huge variety of enemies<br>Not just bosses, but monsters and traps and all sorts of stuff. I've been constantly impressed by this. Even after so much time with the game there's still plenty I haven't even seen yet.<br></li><li>8. And of course the whole &quot;lock and key&quot; concept.</li></ul><br><i>You can read the entire comment here:<br><a href=""http://steamcommunity.com/app/506870/discussions/0/135509024342743670#comment_content_135509472113184826"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer""  >http://steamcommunity.com/app/506870/discussions/0/135509024342743670#comment_content_135509472113184826</a><br><br>We continue with our own, inferior description:</i><br><br><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/506870/extras/strook3.png?t=1574761931"" /><h2 class=""bb_tag"">The goal of Unexplored</h2>The goal of Unexplored is to find the dragon in the depths of the dungeon of doom, slay it to claim the Amulet of Yendor and bring it back to the surface. Every run, the game will create an intricate map of dungeons, hinting at foes to come and solutions for puzzles you’ll face.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Lots Of Bosses</h2>During your adventure through the dungeons, you’ll regularly face off with one of over fifty possible bosses. These range from the Queen Ant, to the Balrog and, yes, several menacing Dragons. Some of these bosses can only be slain with the right weapons, so make sure not to miss those on the previous levels.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Uncover Secret Items</h2>In the spirit of roguelikes, the game does not tell you which potions will save you, and which will kill you. You’ll have to find out yourself either by taking risk or using the right Magic Scrolls. Same story for the Enchanted Weapons: are they blessed with divine powers or cursed with deadly spells?<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Puzzles</h2>Pitted throughout the dungeons you’ll encounter strange statues. Some of these are part of puzzles and solving those may reap great rewards. So, you may want to pick up and read the books you’ll see lying around. They may feature hints on how to solve a puzzle, even one a few levels deeper.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Weapons</h2>You’ll be able to equip two items and wield them both. In the darkest deeps you might want to hold a burning torch beside your axe. Bats tend to be killed easily from a distance by throwing daggers at them, so why not equip them in both slots? Or wield a whip, no better, the Flaming Whip you just plucked from that Balrog you managed to finally kill. Or… perhaps it’s best you start with a shield. A big, enchanted shield. Yes.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Armor</h2>Your starting armor may not seem like much, but that’s only because… well, because it IS not that much. It will keep you safe from the bites of bats, but don’t try your luck with an Orc. Beat the right foes to collect their leather breastplates or chainmail. Or… equip the right cloak on go stealth…<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Wait, Stealth?</h2>Yes, that is an option. You can go unnoticed for a long time and execute surprise attacks for added damage. Like everything in Unexplored, it’s up to you to weigh the rewards versus the risk. Because a surprise attack on a Necromancer may sound like a terrific idea, but it’ll probably survive your first strike, leaving you quite vulnerable in your cloak of cloth.<br><br><br><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/506870/extras/strook4.png?t=1574761931"" /><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Progression</h2>Unexplored features several kinds of progression for you and your character. The most important is simple: experience. Expect to die a lot in the beginning, whilst learning exactly how to play the game. But you will learn and before you know, you reach a deeper level every run. However, there’s more than just experience. Within each run, you’ll find Potions of Strength, drink those and your power increases for as long as your stays alive. A Potion of Life not only completely heals your hero, it increases the amount of Hit Points. Upgrading your equipment by combining it with certain magic items on an anvil will grant you perks for the time being. Offer to the Gods, and you may receive another upgrade.<br>However, if you die, your powers die with you. Unexplored is a game featuring perma-death.<br>Nevertheless, some upgrades are permanent. When you unlock achievements, you unlock equipment and items you can purchase before you start a new run. You pay for these items with the other permanent feature: gold. Your hero will inherit all the gold your previous one owned. So it is always an absolutely fabulous idea to try an open as many chests as possible, you might get rich trying.<br>Or, just spend it all during your run when you meet one of the vendors. Yes, you heard that correctly: during the game you will be able to spend your gold on new equipment and potions. Obviously, if you subsequently fail, all that gold is lost. Like in forever.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Crafting and Mixing</h2>The deeper you go, the more dangerous the dungeons will be. So, make sure to pick up the right equipment, potions and scrolls along the way. You can even craft better items and mix healthy or plain deadly drinks.<br><br><br><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/506870/extras/strook5.png?t=1574761931"" /><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Foreshadowing…?</h2>Part of Unexplored’s allure is the way it generates the dungeons. Not just the levels themselves (see this video about Cyclic Dungeon Generation), but all the dungeons in their entirety. The game knows what you’ll face on the deepest levels even before you start wandering the first one. So, it will provide you with hints, keys and notes about what to expect down the line. Best keep an eye out for those.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">That’s It?</h2>No, of course not. Unexplored is a game filled with content, with lava and water, plants and trees (flammable trees that is), with hidden doors and locked doors (use lockpicks!), with small bosses and big bosses and with so much more. But we won’t spoil everything here. It’s up to you to find out! So, go have yourself an adventure! You’ll love it!<br><br>***************************************<h2 class=""bb_tag"">community</h2>Unexplored has a fantastic community of players helping each other out. They have been an integral part of the development of this game. So, if you're really stuck, let us know in the Steam forum, and we, or one of the other players, will try and help you out."

This time around Meat Boy is always running, like<strong> literally...it's an auto-runner</strong>. He can't stop and he won't stop. Levels are brutal, death is inevitable, and players will get that sweet feeling of accomplishment after beating a level. Players will run, jump, punch and kick their way through familiar settings and totally new worlds.<br><br>What’s better than playing through Super Meat Boy Forever once? The answer is simple: Playing through Super Meat Boy Forever several times and having new levels to play each time. <strong>We created over 6000 level chunks</strong> and smash them together to create new unique levels and each time the game is completed the option to replay the game appears and generates a whole new experience by presenting different levels with their own unique secret locations. We’ve handcrafted literally thousands of levels for players to enjoy and conquer. You can replay Super Meat Boy Forever from start to finish several times before ever seeing a duplicate level. It is truly a remarkable feat of engineering and a monumental example of ignoring the limits of rational game design and production.<br><br>Super Meat Boy Forever takes place a few years after the events of Super Meat Boy. Meat Boy and Bandage Girl have been living a happy life free of Dr. Fetus for several years and they now have a wonderful little baby named Nugget. Nugget is joy personified and she is everything to Meat Boy and Bandage Girl. One day while our heroes were on a picnic, Dr. Fetus snuck up on them, beat Meat Boy and Bandage Girl unconscious with a shovel and kidnapped Nugget! When our heroes came to and found that Nugget was missing, they knew who to go after. They cracked their knuckles and decided to never stop until they got Nugget back and taught Dr. Fetus a very important lesson. A lesson that can only be taught with punches and kicks."

Create massive battles with absolutely no limits. Want to see 10,000 chickens fight an army of Romans?? Sure, why not. Want to see a company of WW2 U.S soldiers fight 11,000 Medieval soldiers?? There are simply no limits to the carnage you can achieve in Epic Battle Simulator. Mess around with a massive variety of units. Everything from, Roman Centurions, Medieval soldiers, Knights, Orcs, Trolls, and yes, chickens! The main focus in this game is giving the player no restrictions to what he can do. That is why we decided not to limit the amount of units in battle. Want to see what a battle of 100,000 units looks like? We don't recommend going past 10,000 for most machines but its your CPU, do what you want! On top of that, you can play as any one of the units in the game, getting up close and personal to help change the tides of a massive battle, while rallying teammates and giving them orders!<br><br>The Technology:<br><br>Unfortunately there really aren't many engines that you can chuck 10,000 characters in and expect good performance. This is why I worked months on end to create the most powerful crowd rendering system ever conceived in Unity engine. The detail of each character has little effect on performance while each individual acts independently, but is working towards a greater good for his team.  Each individual decides his own path and navigates complex environments. But I didn't stop there! With the large open environments, I needed a more dynamic lighting solution than the one built in to Unity engine. So I built my own dynamic global illumination lighting engine. This enables bounce light completely in real time. What does that mean? That means every piece of shiny armor is reflecting it's true surroundings, every bright surfaces illuminates it's surroundings and effects the overall lighting. <br><br>Yes I worked hard to bring this game to life, may you all inflict carnage upon it!"

<br />
Postaw wszystko na jedną kartę, by uciec z najcięższych więzień na świecie. Odkrywaj największe więzienia oraz ich piętra, dachy, szyby wentylacyjne i podziemne tunele. <br />
Żyj zgodnie z więziennymi zasadami: uczestnicz w apelach, wykonuj więzienne zadania, trzymaj się ustalonej rutyny… a po cichu knuj plany wydostania się na zewnątrz!<br />
Zwiewaj z przeróżnych miejsc – od lodowego więzienia Fort Tundra po gnający przez pustynię pociąg czy nawet poza naszą atmosferę!<br />
<br />
Stwórz własnego więźnia!<br />
<br />
Czas sprawić, by więzień odpowiednio wyglądał. Wybieraj spośród olbrzymiej puli elementów. Niech Twoja postać będzie wyjątkowa! W końcu jak planować wielkie ucieczki – to z klasą.<br />
<br />
Ucieknij z ekipą!<br />
<br />
Połącz siły z 1–3 znajomych i razem stwórzcie niepokonaną ekipę mistrzów ucieczek – i dokonajcie najśmielszych ucieczek w historii! Spotkajcie się online albo na kanapie i szykujcie się na podstępne przygody! Współpraca pozwoli przygotować bardziej rozbudowane i przebiegłe plany.<br />
Masz ochotę na odrobinę rywalizacji? Wskocz do trybu rywalizacji i udowodnij, że przewyższasz znajomych umiejętnością ucieczki z każdego więzienia! Jeśli wszystko zawiedzie, rozwiążcie sprawy na więziennym dziedzińcu. Pięściami.<br />
<br />
Dopracuj plan ucieczki!<br />
<br />
Pobyt w więzieniu wymusza kreatywność i ogranicza zasób dostępnych narzędzi. Do osiągnięcia celu musisz stworzyć broń i narzędzia, łącząc ze sobą przedmioty codziennego użytku takie jak mydło czy skarpetki. Kradnij widelce ze stołówki i wykop w swojej celi tunel. Z gazet stwórz plakat i użyj taśmy, aby ukryć dowody. Szybko się przekonasz, że szara taśma rozwiązuje (prawie) wszystkie problemy!<br />
<br />
Przygotuj się na walki! <br />
<br />
W Escapists 2 wprowadzony zostaje nowy system walki, dzięki czemu więzienne bijatyki są jeszcze lepsze. Blokuj ciosy i łącz różne ataki, jednocześnie trzymając dystans do przeciwnika, by zdobyć przewagę. Pamiętaj o siłowni, tam zdobędziesz trochę mięśni.<br />
<br />
Nowe sposoby ucieczki!<br />
<br />
Każde kolejne więzienie będzie o bardziej zaostrzonym rygorze – więc plany ucieczek będą musiały być bardziej… wyrafinowane. Z każdego więzienia można uciec na wiele sposobów. Spróbuj na przykład sporządzić miksturę, za pomocą której sfingujesz swoją śmierć. Wtedy kostnica odwali za ciebie całą robotę!<br />
<br />
Popuść wodze wyobraźni i zbuduj więzienie swoich marzeń!<br />

She usually has worries in her mind, and doesnât speak often. Therefore, her classmates believe that she is unpredictable. As a born beauty, she is busty. She could have become a popular beauty in the school. However, she is not so popular, because she is not good at social contact. She only has some fans who admire her secretly. She is able to peacefully accept things unacceptable to ordinary people, which probably results from her fatherâs job, a war photographer.

However, up until this point, manipulating a bot would require significant amounts of programming experience. It's time for that to change.<br><br>Discord Bot Maker is powerful, yet flexible, tool that allows both experienced programmers and bot newcomers to construct outstandingly effective bots in a matter of seconds.

Commands are manually called functions that invoke specific actions. These are done by sending specific words or phrases into the chat. The other half of the system involves &quot;events&quot;. These will invoke functions based on certain conditions, such as members leaving/joining the server, the creation of channels, the banning of members, etc.<br><br>Both commands and events call upon &quot;actions&quot; that the developer selects. Here's a sample of some of the supported actions:<br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Sending Messages<br></li><li>Generating Embedded Messages<br></li><li>Creating Roles and Channels<br></li><li>Sending Local Files<br></li><li>Dynamically Editing Images<br></li><li>Manipulating Emojis<br></li><li>Storing and Controlling Data<br></li><li>Applying Logic Sequencing<br></li><li>Banning or Kicking Members<br></li><li>Being Awesome<br></li><li>And much more!</li></ul><br>Not to mention, Discord Bot Maker provides a modifiable action system.

From devious D-Class and cunning scientists to elite Mobile Task Force units (MTF), rebellious Chaos Insurgency (CI), and even the horrific SCP Entities, there are many key roles to play in this gruesome affair, so... <strong><i>How will you act amidst a containment breach?</i></strong><br><br><i>SCP: Secret Laboratory (SCP: SL)</i> is a free-to-play multiplayer horror game heavily based on the SCP Foundation series and its expanded universe of monsters and paranormal phenomena. The primary objective of the SCP Foundation (also “the Foundation”) is to safeguard the world from any and all entities, objects, or phenomena that are deemed potential threats to humanity, and thus to uphold the normalcy of the modern world. Recently, however, Chaos Insurgency forces have begun acting against the Foundation in pursuit of a future where humanity reigns supreme.<br><br>The question is: <strong><i>What role will you play?</i></strong><br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>D-Class Personnel –</strong> Inmates kept within the bowels of the Foundation sites as lab rats; test subjects at the mercy of the Foundation’s cruel practices. Escape from your confines and rebel against your imprisoners — by any means necessary.<br></li><li><strong>Foundation Scientists –</strong> Researchers, engineers, and division specialists; you must ensure your own survival until an MTF extracts you from the ensuing pandemonium. Use your wit — and access cards —  to survive. But be wary of the Class-D scurrying beneath you; they’ll do anything to escape their confines.<br></li><li><strong>Nine-Tailed Fox Units –</strong> The first MTF units to respond to the emergency. Your mission: To extract valuable Foundation personnel and to, with the utmost vehemence, terminate or re-contain any SCPs that have escaped.<br></li><li><strong>Foundation Security –</strong> On-site security personnel charged with restoring order amidst the chaos. Evacuate Scientists, terminate D-Class Personnel, re-contain escaped SCPs, and above all do whatever it takes to restore normalcy to your site.<br></li><li><strong>Chaos Insurgency –</strong> Once a mere splinter cell force and now a formidable military power, yet still but a shadow of their former Foundation employers. Your primary objective is to purge the facility of Foundation personnel and seize the “assets” that are deemed to serve the best interests of Delta Command, your elusive overseers.<br></li><li><strong>SCP Entities –</strong> Typically hostile sentient beings of an anomalous nature, all of which are extremely different from one another. You are to consider yourself an enemy of all humans, and formidable ones at that. Do not accept any attempts to compromise — you are naught but death.</li></ul><br>With each match comes new experiences, thrills, and threats. You will battle for survival with every faction: SCP Entities rampaging on their path to escape, Chaos Insurgency sabotaging the Foundation, MTF and Security mobilizing to secure the facility, and armed Scientists and D-Class who refuse to take “no” for an answer. Be prepared for anything.<br><br>Rest assured, you will encounter many threats.

Simply peering at it will induce a state of unstoppable rage, in which it massacres anything around with its immense strength. Running is futile.

There is no third glance — you're dead by then.<br></li><li><strong>SCP-939 –</strong> A pack-dependent predator that intelligently mimics human voices to deceive and entrap its desired prey.

Five Nights at Freddy’s: Security Breach is the latest installment of the family-friendly horror games loved by millions of players from all over the globe. Play as Gregory, a young boy trapped overnight in Freddy Fazbear’s Mega Pizzaplex. With the help of Freddy Fazbear himself, Gregory must survive the near-unstoppable hunt of reimagined Five Nights at Freddy’s characters - as well as new, horrific threats.<br />

THE HUNTERS AND THE HUNTED - Once nighttime protocols are initiated, the animatronics at Freddy Fazbear’s Mega Pizzaplex will relentlessly pursue all intruders.

ADAPT TO SURVIVE - Access the building’s security cameras to survey the environment and plan your route through danger. Distract enemies by knocking over paint cans and toys - just slip away before enemies are drawn to your location. Hop into hiding spots and allow danger to pass, or try to outrun your pursuers. Play your way, but be prepared to adapt.<br />

The graphics are made to be both enticingly beautiful and realistic, bringing out enhanced facial expressions, such special effects as depiction of sweat and dirt on character models, and realistic hit effects.<br><br>[The Triangle System]<br>Following the tradition, fights in DEAD OR ALIVE 6 are based on a triangle system: strikes beat throws, throws beat holds, and holds beat strikes. Landing a well-timed attack of the type that beats your opponent’s attack, like landing a strike when an opponent tries to throw, will result in a Hi Counter attack and do more damage.<br><br>[New Combat Mechanics - Break System]<br>In this new title, we are introducing a new Special Move Gauge (Break Gauge) to the DEAD OR ALIVE series, adding a new dramatic strategic element to the fights. This element is made to be accessible and easy to use even for people who are new to the world of fighting games, and is activated by simply pressing the [RB] button.<br><br>[Break Blow] <br>A strong, high-damage special move that knocks your opponents down. The first part of the move also parries incoming attacks, working as both an offensive and defensive move!<br><br>[Break Hold] <br>A convenient counter technique that can also be used while the player is heavily stunned. It should only be used in tight situations due to its light-damage output.<br><br>[Fatal Rush]<br>A powerful combo with a dramatic finishing move, activated by consecutively pressing the [RB] button. While it is made to be easy to use for beginner players, it can also be employed in more than one creative way by the experienced competitors.<br><br>[New Danger Zones]<br>[Rumble Danger]<br>If knocked into onlookers, they will push the player back into the center of the stage. It is a trap that combines the atmosphere of a real street fight with strategy.<br><br>[Mass-Destruction]<br>If the opponent is knocked back into a large stack of boxes or barrels with a “Break Blow” or ”Fatal Rush” it will cause a large chain-explosion. This will lead to a huge burst of damage and produces an exhilarating rush."

Through use of the game's flowchart system, players navigate through the story and uncover clues to unravel the mysteries of Urashima, the titular island.<br />
<br />
The story of ISLAND revolves around Sanzenkai Setsuna, a young man who wakes up on the shore of Urashima with no memories of his past. During the game, you'll explore Setsuna's relationship with three girls on the island, Rinne, Karen, and Sara. As he uncovers the hidden secrets of Urashima's past - and future - Setsuna must fight against fate to protect that which he treasures most.<br />
<br />
Will you be able to discover the truth and save Urashima, or find yourself lost among the ISLAND's many dead ends?<br />
<br />
World and Background<br />
<br />
Urashima is a small island, far from mainland Japan. It's a true utopia, blessed with rich natural beauty. But the island harbors a difficult past, and it's about to be erased, silently, from history.<br />
Soot blight syndrome, an endemic disease, has brought about a rift between the island and the mainland. An offshore platform intended for marine research has long been left abandoned; five years ago, three separate incidents brought the once influential Three Families of Urashima to near ruin. Rumors about children being spirited away have become part of the local folklore, alongside another legend, one that has been repeated on the island since time immemorial...<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me tell you the legend of this island: it's a story of tragic love...&quot;<br />
<br />
The key to saving the island lies with three girls, each of whom belongs to one of the Three Families. These girls aren't able to change the fate of the island by themselves, but might they succeed with the help of the young man who's just washed ashore? Claiming that he's traveled back in time, the man immediately sets out on a lonely path, challenging the longstanding traditions of the island, and seeking to change the future. But those aren't his only goals...<br />
<br />
How will his presence transform the lives of these three girls, the future of the island, and the fate of the world...?"

This isn't relevant to the game page but, I would just like to say that this is a very special game that comes from a place of true passion, respect and a love for the art form that is video games. After releasing my first game on here in 2016, I decided to take a step back for a bit to learn more and really improve upon my skill sets to become the best game developer that I could be. Games should have a certain level of polish and quality to them and I now understand the importance of that. Because just like grandma's cookies, games should be made with love and care. Nobody wants to eat sloppily made, poorly put together rushed out cookies. My experience developing this game over the course of nearly 2 years has taught me a lot and I feel that I have greatly matured as a video game developer and artist. To me, Giraffe Town is much more than another one of my silly ideas. It is a personal love letter expressing how I feel about indie games and what indie games are to me. And that is crazy, over-the-top, extremly ridiculous and very ambitious ideas that would never be accepted or created by most mainstream triple-A developers. This is where indie devs come in. Thanks for stopping by and here's to independent artist everywhere! I look forward to bringing more of my ideas to life in the future. Enjoy!<br><br><br>-Samer Khatib (Snowconesolid)<br>(Greatest independent game developer of all time and space)<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/941480/extras/samerKhatibBanner_SteamPage.png?t=1554767177"" /><br><img src=""https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/941480/extras/samerKhatibBanner2_SteamPage.png?t=1554767177"" />"

Adventure aside, this game also draws a vivid picture of the darkness filled inside Hakoniwa City. As a human the protagonist can't do much about it, but he has been observing. What will he see?<br />
<br />
✿Intro✿<br />
Female detective of mystery, ganki girl of beauty, choose between those two as you company to go through all kinds of challenge. The choice is important, vital even. It'll shift the story into different directions. <br />
Enough CGs, mysterious events, evocative stories, a fantasy is born. <br />
<br />
✿Storyline✿<br />
Our protagonist, ,Wakui Arata is a student in the artificial city called Senba City. <br />
Senba City, also called Hakoniwa City, is a man-built city.<br />
<br />
Some day in October, the MC got a invite from the student union of Tsunubane called Berizurukai.<br />
Union president offered the MC &quot;investigate the campus&quot; quest. <br />
<br />
From April this year, there has been a series of shocking events. <br />
During this time, there has been 6 students missing from Tsunubane but due to there's not any witness, the events didn't raise the awareness of citizens. <br />
<br />
Although the school has nothing to do with the missing students, they still find it very omnious. <br />
Our MC, though not very willing to, still started to investigate. <br />
<br />
He has tried to refuse, but Shizuku forced him to do it or the history that he wrote a very stupid novel before moving here would be exposed. <br />
<br />
Arata started unwillingly. <br />
With the cooperation of his only friend, the creepy Iriya Koko, the whole thing got weirder. <br />
<br />
The enthusiastic detective Maezono Kirika and the 'creepily' cute Iriya Koko, which one would you choose to accompany you to the end?<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Arata, wanna reveal the secret with me?<br />
<br />
All the characters in this game are all 18+ years old. <br />
<br />
This game is pure fantasy, there's no connection between the fictional places in the game and the real places in real world."

They gather around sects, institutions which train their bodies, minds and souls to be worth eternal life. But in return for such great power, you must be willing to guard the balance between good and evil -- no matter the cost.<br><br>Unfortunately, greed is inherent to human nature, so it also blinds cultivators. Your master didn’t realize until it was too late, and the Taiyi Sect burnt to the ground for his mistake. Your brothers and sisters will never come back, but the Taiyi Sect can still be reborn from its ashes. Its seeds are scattered around Tiancang, waiting for you to find them. This is what your grandmaster would have wanted.

Its gameplay is inspired by famous games like Rimworld and Dwarf Fortress, as well as The Legend of Shushan Swordsman and Martial Kingdoms.<br><br>As a grandmaster, you’ll bring the Taiyi Sect back to its glory days by training new apprentices, gathering knowledge and expand your domain through commerce and political alliances to gain influence over other sects.

Each mission includes a unique environment, story, gameplay, and monster. Have fun with your friends trying to complete each eerie paranormal mission, and help PAH Inc. capture the supernatural entities.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">THE DOLLS MISSION STORY</h2>You just signed on with PAH Inc. Paranormal Activity Helpers Incorporated, yeah sounds corny, but the pay is great. They said you won't ever be in any real danger, and they have tons of work right now. Your first job is at some old haunted house. There is a broker wanting to put the house for sale, but with everyone in the town spreading rumors of evil living inside the house, he needs some proof that it is safe. He actually seems creeped out himself. Anyway, he hired PAH Inc. to check the place out. You can go check it out alone if you'd like, but I would take at least 3 more friends with me. Check the place out, and if there is anything supernatural going on, try to bring evidence back to PAH Inc.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">MYSTERY OF THE HOUSE</h2>This house was built over 100 years ago. The owners ran a funeral parlor. They held normal funeral services such as ceremonies, wakes, cremation and burying the dead. The rumor around town is that they also offered a very special service, a way to talk to your deceased loved one on last time. Several people paid for the service, and after some type of ritual, they were able to speak to the dead. Something apparently went wrong during one of the rituals. A person from town and the owners of the house disappeared and were never seen again. Over the last century, a few people that investigated the incident never returned. A few kids sneaking around the place claimed to hear laughter and see a little girl in the window. There probably isn't any truth to any of it.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">GAMEPLAY</h2>In Pacify, you will be running for your life around the narrow corridors of a dark, old house. There is a little girl that switches between good and evil roaming around. Different circumstances can cause her to change. Once the evil takes over, it will chase you and your friends all over the house. You must find a way to Pacify the evil and escape the house. As the game progresses, the evil gets smarter and faster.<br><br>Play alone in single player mode, or play with up to 3 more friends in multiplayer. In multiplayer mode, you can choose to play with or against your friends. Read the notes for clues about Pacifying the girl. Find and use keys, dolls, wood and matches to help you on your way. The girl can hear and see you. Stay out of sight, and stay as quiet as possible. Try different types of strategies to win.<br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Single Player Mode<br>You can go in the house alone, but the game will be difficult. You must do the work of 2-4 people all by yourself. It is possible though and very scary to take on the girl all alone! <br><br></li><li>Co-Op Mode<br>In co-op multiplayer, you work together trying to help each other escape the house. You can save each other from the girl by interrupting her when she catches someone. <br><br></li><li>PVP Mode<br>In pvp mode, everyone is an intern for PAH Inc. vying to get a full time position. The person that does the most work gets hired. You can push each other down and get in each other's way.

class=""bb_tag"">游戏剧情</h2>	秦朝是中国历史上第一个中央集权专制王朝，它的创始人秦始皇嬴政，也是中国历史最伟大的君王之一，他统一了诸侯纷争的战国时代，建立秦帝国。他统一中国的度量衡和文字；他派人修建了著名的万里长城。但是他似乎做错了一件事情，把自己的大儿扶苏发配边疆，在历史上扶苏是被弟弟胡亥和赵高所陷害而死，但是在这个游戏中扶苏并没有死，他做为太子为了复仇而踏上的艰难的旅程。游戏主人公扶苏，本来继位的应该是他。父亲无故的死亡、弟弟无端的陷害、家人无辜的被杀、旧友无情的出卖、义士无私的帮助、爱人无微不致的关心。使扶苏在这个乱世力图报仇，力图有所作为。他可不可杀死陷害他的仇人呢？他可不可以力挽秦朝覆灭的狂澜呢？他可不可以与相爱的人永远生活在一起呢？他可不可以建立自己的国度使人民安居乐业呢？一切都靠玩家的努力！<br>你从没想过，自己堂堂的大秦太子，有一天会陷入千里亡命的境地。父皇的一纸诏书竟然要你自尽，任你挠破了头，也想不出这究竟原因何在？若非蒙恬老将军拼死掩护你逃出生天，恐怕你早已是地府的冤魂了。而此时的你心中只有一个念头：回到咸阳！<br>从上郡杀出重围，一路上秦兵围追堵截搜捕甚急，而你身上也早已是伤痕累累，血染甲袍。数天的亡命旅途让你的神经近乎于麻木，连伤口的疼痛似乎也已经感觉不到了。在赵村外，你遇到了常往军营送粮的农夫赵五夫妇，他向你指明了南去咸阳的道路，又见你衣甲鲜明太过引人注目，于是以自己的衣物相赠。你脱下血迹斑斑的盔甲，换上农夫装扮继续向南逃亡。然而就在你走后不久，秦兵追了上来，赵五隐瞒了你的行踪，不料却被秦兵发现了你的衣甲。 <br>	最后来说说游戏的名字。《秦殇(shang)》两字正是游戏的灵魂所在。“殇”字深奥，它有夭折；战死者，死在外面的人两种意思。这个古意十足的字，与游戏本身有着完美的契合度。游戏是从秦始皇死于沙丘开始，直至秦国覆灭为止。秦国作为中国历史上第一个统一的封建王朝，自建立到灭亡只有短短的15年，喻之为夭折，当不为过。而其间陈胜、吴广大泽乡起义反秦，后因内部勾心斗角也是最终夭折。最后楚霸王乌江自刎更是让人感慨英雄早逝。游戏通过主角眼睛看到的当时社会：凄凉悲切，殇者满目，客死他乡的劳工、黔首戍边的民夫、英勇不屈的义军、负隅顽抗的秦兵.似乎只有一个“殇”字才能够如此精练的体现。而扶苏在游戏中的命运，和“殇”更是牢牢的结合。<h2 class=""bb_tag"">特色系统</h2><br>采集系统<br>通过猎杀野兽，玩家可以得到各种兽皮、兽骨及兽筋。通过采矿伐木，可以获取各种矿材、木料。通过买卖交易，能得到更多稀有物品。所有物品玩家都有可能经由打造而铸成您自己的神兵利器或是绝世铠甲。可以为自己打造的武器命名，使它成为玩家的专有法宝。在游戏中，可以将各种装备组合成为一套武装，大大节约行囊空间，并且通过热键不用打开道具界面就能更换各种武装。所有武器防具均具有各自的五行属性，根据敌人状况选用不同武器，就能达到最佳的攻击效果。主角在装备某种武器和盔甲后他（她）在游戏中的形象也会随之改变。<br><br>战斗系统<br>游戏采用即时战斗的方式，只通过鼠标即可控制战斗进行，玩家也可自己定义快捷键来辅助战斗。可以利用各种环境布设陷阱，采取各种诱敌策略，灵活运用每位英雄的独特技能或法术，通过丰富的战术组合使每一场战斗都成为一次新的冒险。可以通过驯服或者召唤各种飞禽走兽来帮助您攻击敌人。在战斗中，有可能会出现误伤的现象。这样会增加战斗的乐趣。战斗激烈时，甚至可以将敌人的盔甲或兵器打落从而获得它。<br><br>任务系统<br>为了使玩家更能体会秦末乱世社会动荡、人民的喜怒哀乐，游戏设计了丰富多样的支线任务，并且精心琢磨，使主线与支线交相呼应，相辅相成。玩家可以依照自己的个性选择与npc的对话，不同的对话将导致不同的后果，不同的完成任务的手段将导致不同的互动结果，是成为善良的天使还是邪恶的凶魔全在玩家一念之间。不同的路线将影响不同的结局，各种出人意料的结局就等待玩家慢慢发掘。<br>游戏在设计上尽量使玩家能够随心所欲，减少限制。玩家可以自己标注地图以方便寻找物品，通过暂停控制游戏节奏可以让不同程度的玩家适应不同强度的战斗需要，升级的自主导向让玩家自己创造自己的英雄战队……随机道具系统能够使武器道具变化多样，难以雷同。<h2 class=""bb_tag"">游戏音乐</h2>游戏还有一个特色，是音乐非常有民族感。游戏的配器以民族音乐为主，但是不局限于现有的民族音乐。因为现有的民族音乐大多来自近代，而游戏要表现的是上古时期的社会。主要采用的民族乐器有：筝，箫，埙，笛，鼓。其它民族乐器适当的采用了，如琵琶，二胡等。游戏使用一个或者多个主旋律，在这个旋律之下，产生若干种变奏。根据游戏情节和气氛的需要，在节奏，曲调，配器等方面产生这些变奏。用以表达激昂的，愤怒的，悲伤的，浪漫的等各种情绪。主旋律用的是交响乐形式表现，也通过重奏或者独奏的形式表现，甚至使用了合唱或者独唱表现。<h2 class=""bb_tag"">多结局系统</h2>最终章<br>从阿房宫中杀出，你闯入赵高府邸寻找赵高。在府内你发现了一个地宫入口。冲破了层层阻碍，你终于在地宫三层找到了赵高。一场你期待已久的复仇决战开始了。这里要注意赵高有两次变身，也就是说要打败他三次才能彻底消灭他。而且每次变身后，赵高的属性都会增强。他法术攻击的威力尤其强大，有时甚至能一击致命，所以要随时注意他的准备动作，一旦发现他要释放强力法术，就要快速跑开，脱离他的法术范围。针对他经常瞬间转移的特性，用强力的远程攻击应该是个不错的方式。另外就是要准备大量的食物药材，随时注意补充生命值。当赵高终于倒在你的剑下，你的心中却并没有大仇得报的快感，只有着无尽的迷惘，你昂首向天，自己的归宿究竟在何方？<br>总结局<br>公元前221年，秦始皇剿平六国，终结了春秋五强争霸，战国七雄逐鹿数百年的纷争，建立了中华历史上第一个统一的王朝——大秦帝国！<br>公元前206年，楚人后裔项羽率领四十万义军攻入咸阳，一把大火将富丽无双的阿旁宫付之一炬，标志着显赫一时的大秦帝国土崩瓦解。<br>在阿房宫烧了三月之久的熊熊烈火中，赢秦列祖列宗历经百年为之前仆后继顽强搏击而创下的皇皇伟业，赫赫声威，伴随着那袅袅青烟黯然逝去，进入了任凭江上钓翁、里巷老妪随意戏说的历史。<br>短短十五载，大秦就像历史长空中划过的流星，在绽放了他耀眼光芒之后，便瞬息消失，无迹可寻。可留给我们的却是无尽的思考与慨叹……<br><br>1归隐桃源<br>手刃仇人的快感并没有在你心中停留多久，耳边隐隐传来的依然是疆场的铁蹄奔雷、百姓的哀鸣呻吟。赵高死了，但战争却并没有因此而结束。战乱的年代带给百姓们的永远是痛苦与伤害，和平才是他们永恒的期盼。而这一切不是杀死一个赵高就能实现的！<br>你最终回到了赵村边那个与世隔绝的世界，为战乱中需要生存渴求安定的百姓建设了一个真正的世外桃源。时光流逝，这个被你命名为“桃花之源”的地方一点点的兴盛起来，居民们安居乐业，其乐融融。你没有告诉他们你的名字，看着洋溢在他们眉宇间的欢乐，你觉得对你而言那已经足够了。<br>必要条件：完成找到桃花源的任务。<br><br>2归隐苗疆<br>既没有兴奋畅快，也没有心满意足，手刃仇敌后你只有一种感觉——如释重负。你将宝剑插在地上仰面向天，想从冥冥的空中找到父亲凝视你的双眼。刘邦的大军已抵城边，社稷已倾，大秦将亡，这不再是你的国家了，你唯有选择离开。<br>茵珠陪着你回到了云雾谷，你在这里开始了真正平静的生活，布衣取代了盔甲，宝剑换作了药锄，你觉得这种无欲无求或许才是真正适合你的归宿。<br>必要条件：茵珠必须在队伍中。<br><br>3归隐扶桑<br>报得大仇的你悄然离开了咸阳，重返泰山。令你吃惊的是，徐福似乎早已料到你会来，一支满载待发的船队在你的带领下，出海东渡，去寻求传说中缥缈虚幻的海外仙山。后世，当扶桑之名传入中原时，没<br>有人想得到这和你的名字是否有着些许微妙的关联。但这一切都不重要，当你登上那个人迹罕至的海岛，你的生命已经开始了新的序章。<br>必要条件：完成卢生事件，找到徐福。<br><br>4归隐塞外<br>默默地还剑入鞘，你觉得自己应该笑，可充塞胸臆的却是一种想哭的冲动。围绕金钱权力，手足可以相残，朋友拔刀反目。手握权杖的人只要一句话，千万人头就会落地。这不是你的世界，你只想离开。你来到北方，融入豪爽质朴的塞外民族，有时与匈奴新单于冒顿一起骑猎于茫茫草原，日子过得单纯简单却快乐。<br>冒顿为了感激你帮助他夺回王位，一直信守诺言，从不侵犯中原。可惜，刘邦统一全国之后，意欲大举攻打匈奴，胸怀雄才伟略的冒顿先是假意示弱，而后乘刘邦在白登山巡视不备之际，突起四十万精兵将其包围，千钧一发之际，借助你的帮忙，刘邦才免于一死。后世人一直对冒顿当时不杀刘邦感到困惑，那是因为他们不知道你的存在，历史就是这样，真正创造历史的人十之八九都没有留下他们的名字。<br>必要条件：帮助冒顿夺得单于之位。<br><br>5皈依墨门<br>你突然觉得自己好累，人为什么要自相残杀？为什么彼此间不能和睦相处？那么多的尔虞我诈，你死我活，为了一点权势连自己的亲兄弟都能出卖，为了一时之利，可以抛弃做人的尊严。如此种种，这些究竟都是为了什么？你记起墨钜方仲经常向自己提起的墨家“兼爱、非攻”的思想，想起旅途中和方仲多次的彻夜畅谈，突然觉得或许只有依照墨家的主张才能营造一个完美的世界。于是，你和方仲四处浪迹，一起为了理想中的世界而奋斗。<br>必要条件：方仲必须在队伍之中。<br><br>6携美归隐<br>都结束了。长久以来，你一直盼望着这一刻的到来，然后当这一刻真的到来的时候，你却突然觉得难以接受，从此以后，自己的存在还有什么意义？仇恨、背叛、奸谋、鲜血、死别……你突然觉得自己是如此孤独，自己已经一无所有！于是，你痛哭失声。一只温暖的手悄悄地放在你的肩头，你转过身，看着这些与自己一同出生入死的女子，她们与自己一样，经历了生离死别，经历了世间的风雨，她们默默地注视着你，是的，从此以后，你便是她们唯一的依靠，唯一的亲人。<br>春夏交替，年复一年，没有人知道扶苏究竟去了哪里。很多年以后，曾经有人在骊山看到一个中年男子在始皇陵前祭奠，他的身后还有几个女子和孩童……<br>必要条件：队伍中全是女性。<br><br>7辅佐刘邦<br>此时此刻，你的心中百感交集。父亲一统江山、君临天下时的霸王气概，儿时和兄弟姐妹一起嬉戏时的无忧无虑，与娇妻新婚燕尔时的柔情蜜意，戍守边关放马大漠时的豪情逸致……过往的一切在你眼前一一浮现。泪，悄然而下。这一切，仿佛在梦中，朦朦胧胧却又如此的清晰，梦醒之后，一切都变了。只有自己儿时便执著的抱负依旧不改——让天下百姓不再受兵戈之苦，不再受分离之痛，不再流离失所。但如今的大秦帝国已风雨飘摇、大势已去，即便自己重登皇位，又能如何？<br>力挽狂澜不如开天辟地！你想到了刘邦。是的，如今群雄四起，但只有刘邦才有君临天下的气概和谋略。项羽不过是有勇无谋的一介勇夫，治天下，非刘邦莫属。于是，你找到刘邦，与张良、韩信等人一起南征北战，终于一统天下。刘邦登基之日，你留信辞行，毅然归隐。信中，你叮嘱刘邦，对任何人都不要提起自己，任何时候都不要告诉别人秦太子扶苏曾助他称帝。从此以后，你只是一个普通的大汉子民，你的名字叫作子秦......<br><br>最普通结局，不需要达成任何条件。</strong>"

Each with unique characteristics, units, cultures and histories, the decision of which is best is up to you. Within the borders of this broken land, three clans maintain an uneasy coexistence, fraught with tension and, at times, slavery and open war.<br><br>The Wolf Clan in the northwest, the Lotus Clan high on their northern plateau, and the Serpent Clan in the fertile lowlands. And always, at least in some minds, there is a ghost of a fourth great clan, the lost Dragon Clan, forefathers of the Serpent. Despite their proximity, no three persons could be more different. As yet there is no clear victor in this three-handed struggle; alliances and enmities are unstable, and you never know who or what might be massing on your borders. If you are to survive in this world, you must study your enemies and your friends alike: know their ways, their warriors, and their weaknesses.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">☯ Dragon Clan: The Path of Righteousness</h2>The ancient Dragon Clan prizes honor above everything else. They are Yang followers with honor as their symbol. Their warriors seek to become one with their weapons. Due to their devotion to honor, the Dragon deity assists them during times of great peril.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">☯ Serpent Clan: The Way of the Wicked</h2>A derivative of the Dragon Clan, the Serpent Clan have forgotten their honorable ways and have resorted to thievery and deceit. Serpent clansmen are Yin followers. Unlike their Dragon ancestors, they do not scorn the use of firearms; instead they have learned to employ its use in many of their fighting arts. Even though the Dragon Clan knew how to use gunpowder, it was the Serpent Clan which uncovered its secrets. Stealthy, flexible, and cunning, the Serpent Clan uses a plethora of Battle Gears to disable their opponents and produce an advantage.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">☯ Wolf Clan: The Spirit of Might</h2>The wild Wolf Clan prizes freedom above all else. They are Yang followers with freedom as their symbol. Unlike the other clans, they have no cavalry, nor do they have healers. They feed the horses to their wolves, which accompany them and partake in their battles. Their wounds knit surprisingly fast, even more so with the use of herbs. They know some magic, and much of what they do know is tied to nature. Wolf clansmen are down to earth, hardworking people, and take a delight in nature. They are also known for their use of shale as their armor.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">☯ Lotus Clan : The Essence of Darkness</h2>The Lotus Clan is the remnant of a Yang Clan of old, but it is now a Yin Clan. Lotus clansmen are Yin followers with corruption as their symbol. They follow the Forbidden Path, which focuses on death and decay. Their religion centralizes around three ancient brothers, now long gone, who tended the Tree of Corruption. The Lotus Clan's strategy is based on their immense understanding of magic, which translates to unit abilities and Battle Gear.<br><br><br>⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀  ⠀   <img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1025600/extras/History_tab.png?t=1620204002"" /><br><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1025600/extras/620x311_TarrantBreakingTheWorld.png?t=1620204002"" /><br><br>Sit by the fire, young nobleman, and help yourself to a goblet of jasmine tea. You are wise to come here. So many warriors before you attempted to unite this realm under their reign. They were brave and strong. They had the noble knowledge of tactics. They knew how to choose the best steel for swords. They had fists that could punch holes through stone walls. They had eyes that could spot a sneaking ninja in the middle of a cloudy night. They had hearts that knew no fear nor remorse. But none of them came to seek advice of an old man living on the mountain. And--one by one--they failed. Their power crumbled, their dreams vanished, and their lives faded. You are wise to come here, young nobleman. But this is only your first step towards the true wisdom and the true power that only comes with balance...<br><br>Once upon a time there was a proud empire with many great clans. The Serpent Clan ruled this empire while the other clans like the Lotus and Crane maneuvered for greater control of it. It is said, that in those times a great darkness grew from the shadows and formed sinister creatures of pure night. Like droplets of rain they dotted the land and overwhelmed the one clan after another. Tarrant, the leader of the Serpent clan, was the first to accept the fate of the empire. He fled to the south with the remnants of the Serpent Clan and its prized possession, the Dragon Orb.<br><br>Further and further they travelled until he could see the Southern Seas and the end of the land. It was here that he turned and faced the Horde. Summoning all the power of the Dragon Orb, he separated the southern tip of the continent from the rest of the mainland with the awesome power of the orb. Neither it nor he would ever be seen again. The Horde could not cross running water, so Tarrant had saved his people at the cost of his own life and the Orb.<br><br>To this protected place came two other Clans, the Lotus and the Wolf. The Lotus Clan, twisted and corrupt managed to cross to safety by means unknown. The Wolf Clan, whose matriarchal Druidesses foresaw the drowning of their lands by tidal wave (a result of Tarrant breaking the world) built massive arks for their people which rode the surge and shipwrecked on the new formed island.<br><br>How they came to know one another and fight for their piece of the island is the story of Battle Realms!"

1068820.0,OVR Toolkit,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1068820/header.jpg?t=1643053241,"<strong>** Please read this section before purchasing! **</strong><br>- OVR Toolkit *only* supports Windows 10 and 11! Not Windows 7 or Windows 8. Windows 8.1 'may' work but is unsupported!<br>- OVR Toolkit *requires* you to have a Windows account with admin permissions and that you run Steam on this same account.<br><strong>- Oculus users may experience decreased performance as games are required to be ran through SteamVR rather than Oculus Runtime. (Read the 'Important Stuff' section!)</strong><br><br><strong>Oculus Rift/S or Oculus Quest/2 users - Read the 'Important Stuff' section before purchase!</strong><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Overview</h2><br>OVR Toolkit is a SteamVR Overlay utility designed to make viewing the desktop within VR easy and intuitive. OVR Toolkit allows you to display specific desktop windows, quickly select between them, use intuitive controls to navigate those windows, and use a virtual keyboard to type.<br><br>Ever wanted to reply to Discord messages without taking off your headset or looking through a nose piece? Ever wanted to pause that song you're listening to without fumbling around on your keyboard? Now you can with ease!<br><br>OVR Toolkit is compatible with all SteamVR compatible headsets. The utility is being built with the Vive/Vive Pro, Valve Index, and Oculus Rift/Rift S in mind though WMR headsets are compatible too. (Compatible controllers require a trigger and grip)<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Features</h2><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li> Overlays over almost all SteamVR applications: OVR Toolkit will display on top of all your favorite titles! (VRChat, Beat Saber, mostly all SteamVR titles, etc.)<br></li><li> Desktop window viewing: Allows you to select a desktop window and display it above your hand, or pin it in the world around you.<br></li><li> Multiple desktop windows: Create multiple different windows and place them in the world around you.<br></li><li> Attach windows to tracked devices: You can make windows move around with either your left or right controllers, headset, or have them stationary in the world.<br></li><li> Curved overlays: Improves readability of large windows in VR by wrapping them around you by a configurable amount? Now you can! (Or you can make the window into a wall by curving it to the max, I don't judge!)<br></li><li> Window re-centering: Optionally enable window re-centering, this will make window's re-appear in front of you when you open Edit Mode. This is useful to easily pull windows to you so you can use them.<br></li><li> Quick selection of desktop windows: OVR Toolkit contains a configuration 'hotkey' menu that allows you to bind buttons on its UI to switch between specific windows in one click.<br></li><li> Intuitive desktop input: Scroll up and down on windows by dragging, make a selection by dragging, like using your finger on a phone but with a VR controller instead! (This makes a lot more sense than it sounds like it does!)<br></li><li> Wristwatch: An overlay displayed on your hand that displays the time, date, as well as Vive/Index controller/Tracker battery percentages, as well as other values such as CPU/GPU/VRAM usage.<br></li><li> Saving/Loading configurations: Like that sweet setup you've made? Well, now you can save it, and load it again next time you launch!<br></li><li> Advanced settings for window capture: Want that 60 FPS window capture experience? Want to make a window slightly transparent so it's less in the way? Want a window to disappear when you're not looking at it? Or when it's past a set distance from you? You can do these with our advanced settings!<br></li><li> Eco Mode: When enabled, performance mode will lower the capture rate of windows you are not using, this drastically increases performance and lowers CPU usage significantly!<br></li><li> Basic media controls: Spotify currently playing song will show on your wrist, along with a play/pause, skip, and previous button. (These buttons will work in other music players too)<br></li><li> Windows notifications: Display your Windows notifications in VR such as Discord messages, 'Your Phone' notifications, and anything else that would typically appear on your desktop as a push notification.</li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Customization</h2><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li> Customize the background (wallpaper) and logo on the phone-like UI.<br></li><li> Choose between several accent colors for various parts of the UI.<br></li><li> Create hotkeys on the home page that show application's icons and allow you to quickly access your commonly used applications.<br></li><li> Customize keyboard layouts! All keyboard layouts are community made within Unity and documentation is provided so you can do this yourself. (Want the keys to spell out funny things like you're in high school again? Now you can!)<br></li><li> Custom Apps allow web developers to integrate web apps into OVR Toolkit, allowing for integrated Twitch chat and games to be made.</li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Simulator Mode - Controller-free mode</h2><br>'Simulator Mode' is a controller-free mode available in OVR Toolkit. In this mode, you can interact with windows using head gaze, and use keyboard binds to move windows around you and change their settings. This mode is perfect for those intending to use OVR Toolkit at a desk or whilst in a sim racing/driving/piloting game!<br>(This mode is still a work in progress, provide feedback in the OVR Toolkit Discord!)<br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li> Move windows with keyboard binds when you have no controllers connected.<br></li><li> Control your cursor position with your head using head-gaze input.<br></li><li> Pin windows around you in your play space to view whilst in games. (Race overlays, etc.)<br></li><li> Quickly toggle open windows with the 'Edit Mode' bind to show/hide some applications such as Discord, web browsers, etc. whilst in games.<br></li><li> Voice Attack ready. (All controls are easily repeatable with the same keyboard key presses to support Voice Attack)<br></li><li> Bindable voice input key using Google Speech to type out a sentence into a text box you have selected.</li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Important stuff you should know about</h2><br>We've tried our best to make OVR Toolkit support everything, but that just isn't how this world works!<br>Please take these compatibility notes in mind before purchasing:<br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li> OVR Toolkit requires being launched as admin, this is due to the inability to capture programs that are running as admin without running OVR Toolkit as admin, so it's needless to say a Windows account with admin privileges is needed. (If you're the only user of your PC, this is probably you)<br></li><li> OVR Toolkit only supports Windows 10 and 11. (This is due to the desktop capture API we use which was only introduced in Windows 10)<br></li><li> Oculus users, don't launch OVR Toolkit through Oculus Home as it will launch the application incorrectly! Use Steam/SteamVR instead! You can set OVR Toolkit to auto-start with SteamVR by referring to our wiki!<br></li><li> Oculus' software will sometimes overlay over our overlay. (This is because Oculus' software displays separate to SteamVR, our application will always display whilst SteamVR is active or you're playing a SteamVR game, just not when you open the Oculus Dashboard)<br></li><li> Oculus users, refer to the OVR Toolkit wiki 'Oculus' page for how to make OVR Toolkit appear in your games!<br></li><li> We cannot display our application over Oculus SDK games. (Our application uses SteamVR to display, though, most Oculus games will have a SteamVR mode, we advise you use this!)<br></li><li> Running games through SteamVR on an Oculus headset may decrease performance, this is not an issue specific to OVR Toolkit. This is due to Oculus rendering the same image twice, once when SteamVR compositor renders the output, then again when Oculus Runtime renders the output. Unfortunately, this is something only Oculus/Facebook can fix!<br></li><li> Windows Mixed Reality users may experience decreased performance running SteamVR games due to double rendering. Please try performance with your games running through SteamVR before you purchase OVR Toolkit. (Most noticeable effects with Flight Simulator 2020)</li></ul> If you have any issues with the application or find other compatibility issues, don't hesitate to contact us! We'll whip up a hotfix ASAP!"

1121710.0,Total Lockdown,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1121710/header.jpg?t=1594656227,"Total Lockdown is a multiplayer online game. In this action shooter, the goal is to survive using any available weapons, gadgets, and tricks. Fight for survival on your own, or with friends at your side. The game takes place in a grim cyberpunk world where corporations wield all the real power and daily live broadcasts of a battle royale inside an enormous skyscraper have become the most popular form of entertainment.<br />
<br />
A defining feature of Total Lockdown is its &quot;vertical&quot; gameplay. As characters move between floors in a hive-like building, the scenery changes rapidly from robot assembly factories to artificial parks with waterfalls and panoramic vistas of a fascinating and heartless metropolis of the future. This approach helps make the gameplay much more dynamic and varied.<br />
 <br />
Participants will get to choose one out of several corporations. As its representatives, they'll gain access to more lucrative quests as well as various unique weapons. During combat, special terminals will offer a wealth of unlockable upgrades. However, other players aren't going to just sit and watch from the sidelines, so intense firefights will frequently erupt around these locations. Much to the delight of the viewers and the eventual winners.<br />
<br />
Players can choose from over 40 different weapons and auxiliary devices, from classic firearms to such exotic pieces as the Gauss rifle, plasma shotgun, or a defender drone that’s ready to throw itself between its owner and enemy fire at any moment. Fighting has never been such fun, with different options to suit everyone's taste.<br />
<br />
Several game modes are available. In the popular Battle Royale mode, 100 players fight on all 24 floors of the skyscraper as they gradually fill up with poisonous gases. The survivors converge on the final safe floor, where a deadly showdown will see a winner emerge.<br />
<br />
Those who prefer more traditional forms of entertainment might want to try the Tournament mode, in which players fight through a tournament bracket to get to the finals. Each match is held on an isolated floor of the building. The survivor will advance to the next stage, keeping all the equipment and weapons they've acquired.<br />

<br />
Unlike the rest of our solitaire games, we did not invent Nerts. We learned about it from our artist Kyle, who has played it for years, and started playing it after lunch in the Zachtronics office. Over time we added more to it, including house rules, longer tournaments, and even a theme song.<br />
<br />
When we started working from home in early 2020 we made a rough version of the game to play over the internet, which eventually (nine months later) was cleaned up and turned into this. The game includes a few Zachtronics additions, like players being allowed to move cards between their Nerts pile and their tableau after Nerts has been called. It's free, but you do technically unlock card backs by owning our other games, so let's pretend that's a legitimate monetization strategy. <br />
<br />
(UPDATE: We've also added an optional &quot;Sponsorship Package&quot; DLC you can purchase, which unlocks a NERTS! Online themed card back and a special holographic foil effect you can use with any of the other card backs.)<br />

Have fun!"

Freedom of choice and multiple approaches to run your business and deal with pressure are key ingredients in this game.<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1149620/extras/GSS_RENOVATE.gif?t=1645434233"" /><br>Buy an abandoned gas station in the middle of nowhere and restore it to its former glory. Get rid of debris and broken furniture, fix up the walls, paint and decorate the place to your liking. <br>Just don’t spend all your cash on the looks right away, you bought a gas station after all. Repair the equipment, buy what can’t be repaired and start serving your customers to earn money for further renovations and improvements.<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1149620/extras/GSS_Expand.gif?t=1645434233"" /><br>You don’t need to stay small. You can expand your gas station to be able to serve more customers. Also, a gas station is not just about selling fuel. You can expand the array of services that you offer to your customers and thus attract more and more varied customers. <br>You have various expansion options at your disposal, from smaller ones like providing toilets, a simple shop to complement your income up to big ones like an entire workshop to perform car repairs or even a car wash. There are quite a few choices and most of the expansions can themselves be further expanded upon as well. There is so much you can do here.<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1149620/extras/GSS_customize.gif?t=1645434233"" /><br>Restoring your gas station is one thing, giving it a personal touch another. The game offers a wide array of options to customize what you have already built and lots of decorations to further enhance the uniqueness of the place. Some decorations can be bought, others have to be acquired during gameplay. <br>It is not just about making the gas station look nice. The more impressive your gas station looks, the more customers will be attracted.<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1149620/extras/GSS_SERVE.gif?t=1645434233"" /><br>Serving your customers is key in running your gas station with success. They all expect to have their cars filled up, their shopping done right away and aren’t that patient even when it comes to repairs of their vehicles. You are going to be dealing with some serious time pressure at peak hours and have to schedule various tasks for when it’s less hectic. Proper time management and choosing the right priorities becomes very important when it comes to keeping your customers happy. <br><br><img src=""https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1149620/extras/GSS_Hire.gif?t=1645434233"" /><br>While you can try, it most cases running a gas station that has been expanded and upgraded offering lots of different services to your customers might be just too much to handle for you alone. This is where employees come into play. You can hire even multiple employees to help you with the various tasks at the gas station. Employees have their own skills and some are better at some tasks than others. Employees also level based on the tasks they perform and become better at them with time. <br><br><img src=""https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1149620/extras/GSS_Stock.gif?t=1645434233"" /><br>You can’t sell what you don’t have. Keeping track of your stock is important and ordering at the right time for the right price helps to keep profits up. To even better use low price opportunities, you can build a warehouse and expand it to allow for larger storage. Keeping a close eye on your stock is crucial as deliveries take time and you really don’t want to run out of goods to sell, not to mention fuel.<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1149620/extras/GSS_Management.gif?t=1645434233"" /><br>We created the game so that if you like, you can dive deep into management features and micromanage the living you know what out of it.

Players can browse the characters uploaded by other players or upload gladiators from their local archives. Players can also choose any team on the leaderboard and click challenge to let their gladiators challenge each other.</strong><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Core Gameplay</strong></h2><h2 class=""bb_tag"">1) Assemble Your gladiators</h2>Buy slaves and train them into gladiators. You will need to manage their attributes, skills, talents, and equip them with the best armors and weapons you can afford. Some of them may exhibit the capacity to become auxiliaries for your crew, such as cooks, healers, drillmasters, blacksmiths, etc.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">2) Claim Your Glory</h2>Send your Gladiators to fight in more than 10 diverse arenas or dispatch them to all kinds of exploration and plunder in the Freelands. Defeat other gladiators and over 30 kinds of monsters. Challenge the champions of other arenas and take over their positions. Create your champions and become the most powerful arena master in the world.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">3) Manage Your Arena</h2>Don’t forget you have an arena to manage! As your gladiators win battles in other arenas, you will gain money as a reward, as well as reputation. Money can buy new slaves, better equipment, and upgrades for your establishment when needed. Use your money wisely because everything in running an arena depends on it. Reputation is important too, as having a high degree of it when holding a game will grant you considerable income.<br><strong><h2 class=""bb_tag"">key Features</h2></strong><h2 class=""bb_tag"">1) All gladiators Are Living People</h2>All gladiators exist dynamically in the game’s world – not just the ones affiliated with you, but also the gladiators in other Arenas or ones who belong to other masters. NPC gladiators will enroll in different competitions held all over the world every day. They could die, get injured, or grow stronger, just as your gladiators do. Whenever you defeat other gladiators, you can either spare their lives or execute them. If you spare gladiators, you may face them again in future clashes.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">2) Rpg Character Development</h2>Blackthorn Arena offers players a cRPG character development system. Choose between 6 major attributes,6 weapon types, 8 unique genres, and combine over 100 combat skills to build a unique fighter. There are no classes, so you create your own! Your fighters will also gain various traits during their gladiatorial career. Some of them may have a strong impact on competitions.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">3) Diverse Equipment</h2>Equip your gladiators with over 200 pieces of armor and weapons, not just for combat effectiveness but also for the aesthetic! Each set of armor has a unique appearance and will be reflected in the game’s advanced avatar system. At the same time, legendary quality weapons and gears are waiting for players to explore and obtain.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">4) Abundant Events and Side Missions</h2>As an arena master, you must deal with several events every day. Some of them may be opportunities while others spell disaster. Thus dealing with all kinds of emergencies also becomes an important and inevitable experience of taking charge in an arena. Meanwhile, there are a large number of side missions in the game. Players can trigger them and send gladiators to participate in the missions such as robbery of caravans, exploration of dungeons, beast hunting, and many other kinds of quests!<h2 class=""bb_tag"">5) Hold Your Venationes! (beast Show) </h2>Players can dispatch gladiators to various exploration areas, discover, defeat or capture powerful and rare fantasy creatures, and put them into their arena, as the finale of hosting Venationes.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">6) A Variety Of Different Arena Rules</h2> The battle between the arenas is not limited to just 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, or 4v4. At the same time, there are different battle modes such as venationes, exhibition, tag fight, throne challenge and tournament to challenge players’ ability.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">7) Strong Opponents and Challengers</h2>Powerful opponents from all different arenas will come to challenge the players' arena at any time! To defend your glory, or to judge the situation to save your strength? Making correct and appropriate judgments is a necessary ability as a qualified arena master.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">8) Real-time Combat With A Tactical Pause</h2>The game’s combat is based on real-time, but you can pause it at any moment to issue a command, switch between characters, or apply several other actions.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">9) Customizable combat AI and switchable battle mode</h2>During fights, you can command only one gladiator at a time. The rest of them will fight automatically. But you can always edit your gladiators' combat AI so that they respond to different situations as you see fit. Besides, the player could switch between automatic combat or manual combat anytime during the fight.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">10) Brutal and Challenging gladiator Career</h2>The career of a gladiator is cruel and gory. Your gladiators could for example completely lose control of themselves due to shattered morale during the battles. And ultimately, be aware that your gladiators may die permanently when they are defeated! So do cherish their lives, but don't get overly attached to them.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">11) Alternative Combat System ：</h2>Blackthorn Arena offers players with both real-time Combat System and Traditional Turn Based Combat System. Players could choose either one of two freely by the begining of the Game. ( P.S : Turn Based is currently still in beta , players might encounter serval bugs and issues during the gameplay. We would continually update to optimize it)<h2 class=""bb_tag"">12) Non-real-Time Online PVP mode </h2>Players can now upload their gladiators to our server!  Players can browse the characters uploaded by other players or upload gladiators from their local archives. Players can also choose any team on the leaderboard and click challenge to let their gladiators challenge each other."

So you can find many familiar stories in your life as Deja-vu scene.<br><strong><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Theme</h2></strong><br>In our creative process, we found that the Internet is more important in our life than everyone's imagination. Social events always have different opinions in the real world. And there is always has a little group of people who enjoy judging others, and because of that, the events would be more complicated, even leading emergencies to happen. When information flow quickly transforms in every place of the world, immorality and illegal news always happen. In this process, more and more people enjoy being judging process.<br><br>After careful consideration, we decided to make an amazing game to let people really know about the dangers of internet world. We focus on the <strong><i>dark web</i></strong>, <strong><i>truly cybercrime</i></strong> and <strong><i>privacy burglary</i></strong>, tried to let gamers can experience being a hacker in the real world. Every little operation would affect the life of the characters in the game, which would let you rethink the relationship between people and the internet.<br><strong><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Features</h2></strong><br>You can do some really hack in our game:<br><br><strong><i>·Web search</i></strong><br>You should collect basic information about the targets through the Internet search.<br><br><strong><i>·Database</i></strong><br>You can use the database to get deep information about targets.<br><br><i><strong>·Crack</strong></i><br>You would get passwords based on the obtained target's information, and use it to log in to accounts of different platforms (including email, social media, chat application, etc.)<br><br><i><strong>·Chat</strong></i><br>The exciting thing is that you need to chat with targets by disguise and use the information to get the trust of the target.<br><br><i><strong>·Picture Analysis</strong></i><br>You can get valuable information and relevant clues from pictures.<br><br><i><strong>·Phishing</strong></i><br>You can send phishing links to hack the targets' hardware devices (computer, mobile phone), and get private information.<br><br>More advanced hacking methods will be unlocked later!<br><strong><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Gameplay</h2></strong><br><strong>·Highly Immersive</strong><br>Gamers play as a hacker in the game, accepts the commission of the company, and solve dangerous incidents.<br><br><strong>·Rich Gameplay</strong><br>There are lots of features of Social Engineering in the game, which is including Detecting, Tracking, Puzzles-Solving, Destroying and Hacking etc..<br><br><strong>·Complex Story</strong><br>The game will judge the good and evil of the player's behavior. Different judgments will lead to different plot directions.<br><br><strong>·Multiple Roles</strong><br>There are many different roles in this game with a flash of personality. Their stories would be dug by yourself.<br><strong><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Written in the end</h2></strong><br>When we decided on the subject matter of the game, we thought about it for a long time. Because of <strong><i>This War of Mine</i></strong>, <strong><i>Papers, Please</i></strong>, <strong><i>Orwell</i></strong> and other excellent indie games, we also want to make a game that allows gamers to think outside the game. We tried so many times to brainstorm.<br>We set up a Social Engineering group to find some experts and ask them about the skills for giving gamers a real hacking experience. We even read the book <strong><i>The Art of Deception</i></strong> written by the famous hacker Kevin David Mitnick to figure out how a real hacker's works. These studies directly opened the door to a new world for all of us. The disciplines involved social engineering, psychology, micro-expressions, phrase skills and so on, which kinds of studies make us have great confidence in the theme of the game and gameplay.<br>Not just professionals and books, we also get inspiration from cinema. For example, through <strong><i>Who Am I: No System Is Safe</i></strong>, we have seen another explanation about hacking skills. Through <strong><i>Searching</i></strong> we have learned how to create storytelling in details and how to let the audiences and games focus on where we expect them to focus. Every times learning makes us closer to the game in my heart.<br><br>So as we mentioned before, this game is very <strong><i>special and unique</i></strong> which combines a lot of creativity. I really hope that you guys could like this game so much. Please feel free to leave your advice and feedback in Community."

Will you do as your sovereign bids and set sail to replenish the palace coffers? Surely the native peoples will offer no resistance to your pilfering. What could go wrong?<h2 class=""bb_tag"">The Physical Laws</h2>Diplomacy Is Not an Option takes the laws of physics very seriously: there are no hit-scan crossbows to be found here! Your archers and siege engines will need clear trajectories to hit their targets, so good placement of your towers and defences is vital. <br>Thousands of enemy soldiers will advance on your walls and archers positioned behind them must fire up and over; dramatically reducing their range and accuracy. Providing your units with elevated firing positions will greatly increase their effectiveness. Likewise, a ballista or catapult-thrown boulder will do no good if they crash into a cliff mid-flight.<br>Consider your gates, your lines of advancement and retreat. Create kill-zones and fall-back positions. You will need to take an active role in combat to get the best from your men.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">The Laws of a Functional Society</h2>The world of Diplomacy Is Not an Option is not a kind one. Food can become scarce, and your soldiers can starve on the battlefield. Homes must be protected, diseases managed, and corpses hauled away and buried with respect.<br>If you do not care for your people you may soon find yourself overrun with a most unpleasant plague, or with battlements guarded only by the wasting bones of your malnourished soldiers.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Economic Laws</h2>A functional army requires a functional economy to support and feed it. Food, Wood, Stone, Iron, and Gold are the foundations of your city’s economy, and you will need to watch your supplies carefully if you are to meet the advancing foe in a timely manner. Gather resources, choose your storage locations, plan your expansions and upgrades with care. The enemy will not cede their lands willingly, and unprotected civilian expansions will fall prey to hostile incursion. <br>Trade, via the impressive merchant dirigible, offers a lifeline to besieged cities, bringing emergency supplies of food to feed the men, or stone to rebuild the walls. It might help just enough to tip the scales. Can you strike the balance between greedy expansion and security? Between builders and farmers and fighters?<h2 class=""bb_tag"">The Laws of Magic</h2>Fickle and treacherous, most shun the use of magic in the lands. Those who dare tamper with the occult are viewed with suspicion and fear, and with good reason. There is a dark history of tainted power that stirs the dead and traps wayward souls. A proper burial for your slain is not just a tradition, it is a necessity. <br>On the lighter side: it can also be used to call down really very big fireballs onto your enemies. So enjoy that too.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">The Fundamental Laws of Life</h2>The game has been designed with freedom as a core concept. The Endless Mode grants you full access to the tech tree and there are no limitations on how you approach the challenges that the procedurally generated maps provide. Go heavy on walls early, build large armies of cannon-fodder, or pursue the macro game of greedy growth and costly investments. Finding which style grants you the most success is up to you.<br>The campaign will offer you challenges of combat and morality: it is a grim and unpleasant world. Few are worthy of your allegiance and even fewer will trust it. As in real life, stupidity and greed lie behind most problems, but here it is far too late to talk it through. You have no recourse to resolve this peacefully. At this stage: Diplomacy Is Not an Option!"

In the Early Access version, drive through Germany, riding in the cab of several different locomotives. Each of these locomotives has its unique characteristics (power, braking, etc.) that you need to fully master to be as effective as possible. Take your passengers through astonishingly beautiful lands, including both town and country, forest and mountains.<br><br><strong>Show your entrepreneurial spirit</strong><br>You not only have to drive the trains, but you also have to grow your company by optimizing your Passenger and Freight activities. Choose a name, a logo, purchase locomotives, and hire drivers, giving them new contracts and exploring new tracks. You must also maintain your locomotives to prevent breakdowns and handle emergency repairs. You are free to accept or refuse contracts: make the right choices, earn money and develop your company!<br><br><strong>A realistic and authentic simulation</strong><br>Train Life involves demanding gameplay based on real-world behavior. You have to respect the rail signals and driving instructions, adapt for rail switches, and manage speed. Make sure you keep an eye on braking distance when you pull into the station and open and close the doors for your passengers. There are also unforeseen situations to manage, such as fallen trees, stalled cars, and trains rolling on your track.<br>The dynamic weather and day/night cycle mean you have to adapt the way you drive to avoid accidents and damage to the tracks."

There are more objectives such as rescuing multiple hostages, arresting or neutralizing specific suspects and more which are being added down the line. Suspects may or may not have patrolling routes that are random every session and can interact with the environment to give it a challenge. They can hide under beds, tables and inside closets. They are also capable of taking a hostage and use them as a shield, making it harder for you to engage. Suspects can also surrender based on a few criteria; If a suspect is outnumbered from behind they will always surrender and if you are one on one with a suspect, based on the suspect's fear level, they may or may not surrender. <br><br><img src=""https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1359090/extras/PlanningTable.gif?t=1632311003"" /><br><strong>PLANNING TABLE</strong><br>At the start of each round, MS-09 Unit (The Attacking Team) can come up with strategies by drawing in the planning table with a 3D miniature version of the location being played similar to the use of blueprints.

1410710.0,Democracy 4,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1410710/header.jpg?t=1642065399,"Democracy 4 lets you take the role of President / Prime minister, govern the country (choosing its policies, laws and other actions), and both transform the country as you see fit, while trying to retain enough popularity to get re-elected...<br><br>Built on a custom-built neural network designed to model the opinions, beliefs, thoughts and biases of thousands of virtual citizens, Democracy 4 is the state-of-the-art in political simulation games. A whole new vector-graphics engine gives the game a more adaptable, cleaner user interface, and the fourth in the series builds on the past while adding a host of new features such as media reports, coalition governments, emergency powers, three-party systems and a more sophisticated simulation that handles inflation, corruption and modern policy ideas such as quantitative easing, helicopter money, universal basic income and policies to cover current political topics such as police body cameras, transgender rights and tons more.<br><br>Democracy 4 is the ultimate sandbox for testing out your political ideas. We all think our politicians are useless and that we could do a better job ourselves, but is that really true? With one eye on the budget, one-eye on the polls, and somehow finding time to watch out for terrorist attacks at the same time, you will find that staying in power while changing society for the better is a tougher job than you ever imagined.<br><br>Would it really be a good idea to legalize all drugs? to give the police machineguns? to ban abortion? to invest heavily in green energy? would UBI really work? can you stay elected after cutting pensions in half to pay for your science budget? There is only one game that lets you find out!<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1410710/extras/character_heads.png?t=1642065399"" /><br><br>The intention in designing this game is to have no implied bias whatsoever (tricky, but we try!) so this is NOT a game that is going to lecture you about politics, or tell you that your beliefs are wrong. This is a strategy game, not a political protest :D. If you want to turn your country into ayn rand's fantasy, abolish all public spending and all taxes, you can do that. it might work, it might not! depending on how you handle it. On the other hand if you want to nationalise the railways, the energy companies, the water companies, cap CEO pay, ban second-home ownership and put universal income in place, you can do that too. All the game tries to do is model the *likely* effects, short and long term of any action you take.<br><br>Because modders have so enthusiastically supported earlier games in the series, we are doing our best to make Democracy 4 as mod-friendly as possible too, and steam workshop support will make choosing and installing mods easy. Ultimately all our data is in text files that you can edit yourself, so if you think our analysis of the link between car tax and car usage is wrong (for example), its trivial to edit it, and share your changes with other players.<br><br>Ultimately Democracy 4 is not a game about simply winning an election, but about running the country. Losing an election is just  the end-game (unless you get assassinated), the real challenge to the game is whether or not you can create a country you are honestly proud of. I hope you enjoy trying :D"

As you wander the endless expanse of humming lights, stained carpet, and old wallpaper, you can collect items, find notes written by previous explorers, and evade glitched entities. Throughout the game, your sanity slowly decreases. The lower it gets, the more bizarre things will occur and the more horrifying beasts you'll run into. You must meditate to regain your sanity before it's too late. Enter The Backrooms takes place over many levels, each with a unique generation algorithm, varying danger, and unexpected oddities.<br />
<br />
Enter The Backrooms is a perfect game for anyone who wants a creepy psychological horror experience at a low price. The game comes with plenty of achievements to obtain and journal pages to collect, many items and artifacts to discover, lots of strange hallucinations to witness, and various levels to explore. Enter The Backrooms promises players an unforgettably surreal experience that no other game provides. That being said, this game is NOT for players who want gorgeous visuals, heavy story elements, intense action, or a very polished package. This game was developed by a single teenager in their spare time and is in no way professionally crafted.<br />
<br />
Much of what's in Enter The Backrooms is based on a collection of fictional writing known as &quot;The Backrooms Database&quot;, which includes a plethora of articles from numerous writers around the world. Some aspects of the game are based entirely on these writings, while others are their own concepts spliced in to make the experience much more cohesive.<br />
<br />
Enter The Backrooms is planned to evolve and update far into the future. There are dozens of concepts for levels, entities, and items that could and most likely will be added."

To that end, players have many actions at their disposal: manage the budget of the party or illegal organization, intervention in the media, give voting advice to Parliament, launch protest movements, lobbying, manipulation of influential persons, funding or recruitment campaigns, creation of violent cells, purchase military equipment, raise an army, seek allies, engage in armed conflict... During elections, players must manage their campaign budget, establish their political agenda, complete their meeting itinerary, confront their adversary in televised debates…<h2 class=""bb_tag"">AI CONTROLLED LOBBYISTS AND CHARACTERS</h2>All actions of the player as head of state or opposition have repercussions and lobbies, social groups, and important national and international figures will intervene if their artificial intelligence deems necessary (press interviews, resignations, protests, strikes, unrest, blocked roads, wars...).<br>To prevent tensions or forge alliances, the player can meet any figure during the meeting or intervene in the media (more than 10 hours of dialogue in the game).<h2 class=""bb_tag"">REALISTIC WARGAMES AND CITY BATTLE PHASES</h2>The world map incorporates all places of conflict down to the smallest detail: occupied territories, besieged cities, locations of military units, international military bases, personnel and equipment of terrorist groups... <br><br>As a warlord, players can direct all of their units from real bases during military conflicts.

In which case, modifying the voting rules will prove particularly interesting.

In I'm on Observation Duty 4 the players job is to monitor live surveillance camera footage and spot anomalies in the monitored rooms. You can swap between different camera-views. An anomaly means that for example something (e.g. a piece of furniture) has moved, an extra object has appeared or something has disappeared. There's also intruders and ghosts! When you notice something is different in any of the monitored rooms you have to file a report by choosing the right location and type of the anomaly to fix it. Anoamalies appear at random so the player never knows what is going to hapen next. Too many active and unreported anomalies means game over. Goal is to survive long enough (from 00:00 to 06:00 in game time). You will need sharp eyes and good memory to survive the entire night. The game contains psychological horror that mainly comes from making the player paranoid about what has changed in the house. There are also some scary monsters that might appear.<br />
<br />
I'm on Observation Duty 4 is the sequel that everyone wanted and deserved. Observation Duty goes back to its roots. Cameras are back. Colors are gone. New anomalies, new intruders, new houses! Same familiar gameplay. Scarier than ever."

1843760.0,Rogue Tower,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1843760/header.jpg?t=1643386141,"Rogue Tower is a tower defense game with roguelike elements and a continuously expanding path which you can influence. Unlock new towers and buildings, build up your defenses, upgrade your towers through card draws and cash, expand the path tactically to control how enemies move and defend your tower.<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1843760/extras/StoreCustomTextBuildTowers3.png?t=1643386141"" /><br>Where you build your towers is the most important aspect to any tower defense game. In rogue tower, the path the enemies must travel continuously extends and grows to much greater lengths than your average tower defense game making tower placement even more important in this game. Not only do you need to carefully consider what kind of coverage they will have, but towers also get a bonus to damage based on their elevation. This means that there are spots which are better than others, but they are limited; which towers do you place on these spots? do you save them for a tower you haven't unlocked yet? or do you put everything you have there now? are the good spots even in a good location or are they too far off the path? These are all strategical questions you will have to answer every game.<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1843760/extras/StoreCustomTextExpandThePath.png?t=1643386141"" /><br>Every level of the game you must choose a direction to expand the path. The path will randomly twist turn and split often. Wrangle what control you can over it to influence the shape of the level and how far enemies must travel down each path to get to the tower. Do you want enemies from all the paths to come one at a time as to not over saturate your defenses? Or do you want all of the enemies to merge together for your AOE damaging towers?<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1843760/extras/StoreCustomTextUnlockUpgrade.png?t=1643386141"" /><br>During each game you will be able to choose random upgrade and unlock cards. These cards will let you build new towers or upgrade existing towers giving them better damage, range or new abilities.<br><br>After each game you will gain experience which can be used to unlock further towers and upgrades to appear in game. You can also unlock permanent upgrades which will persist through every game you play giving you a small boost to the start of your next game.<br><br>With over 400 unique cards and upgrades there is nearly endless replayability!<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1843760/extras/StoreCustomTextLearn.png?t=1643386141"" /><br>Your tower will be attacked by several different types of monsters. As the game progresses you will encounter more complex and dangerous enemies. They can heal, sprint, launch attacks or even spawn more enemies themselves. Many of the abilities that monsters have will apply to nearby monsters making enemies dangerous in large packs depending on the enemies you are facing; even a weak monster can buff up a stronger one to dangerous levels.<br><br>Each tower deals with certain types of enemies better than others. So every game you may have to consider whether to build up defenses in advance or to wait for the new threats to emerge and adapt on the fly.<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1843760/extras/StoreCustomTextJoinTheDiscord.png?t=1643386141"" /><br>Join the Die of Death community to stay up to date with any new development, give feedback and suggestions or just chill with us in our memery.<br>Discord: <a href=""https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://discord.gg/2brzHhh6k9"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""  >https://discord.gg/2brzHhh6k9</a><br>Twitter: <a href=""https://twitter.com/DieOfDeathGames"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer""  >https://twitter.com/DieOfDeathGames</a>"
